Abstract
That trivialism ought to be rejected is almost universally held. I argue that the rejection
of trivialism should be held in suspicion and that there are good reasons for thinking
that trivialism is true. After outlining in chapter 1 the place of trivialism in the history of
philosophy, I begin in chapter 2 an outline and defense of the various arguments in
favor of the truth of trivialism. I defend four such arguments: an argument from the
Curry Paradox; and argument from the Characterization Principle; an argument from
the Principle of Sufficient Reason; and an argument from the truth of possibilism.
In chapter 3 I build a case for thinking that the denial of trivialism is impossible. I begin
by arguing that the denial of some view is the assertion of an alternative view. I show
that there is no such view as the alternative to trivialism and so the denial of trivialism is
impossible. I then examine an alternative view of the nature of denial – that denial is not
reducible to an assertion but is a sui generis speech act. It follows given such an account
of denial that the denial of trivialism is possible. I respond to this in two ways. First, I
give reason for thinking that this is not a plausible account of denial. Secondly, I show
that even if it is successful, the denial of trivialism is still unassertable, unbelievable, and
severely limited in its rationality.
In chapter 4 I examine two important arguments that purport to show that it is
impossible to believe in trivialism: one from Aristotle and a more recent one from
Graham Priest. According to Aristotle, it is not possible to believe in trivialism because
such a belief is incompatible with being able to act in a discriminating manner.
3
According to Priest, belief in trivialism is incompatible with being able to act with a
purpose. I show that there are a number of ways to respond to such arguments, and so it
is far from obvious that it is impossible to believe in trivialism.
In chapter 5 I reply to one of the few sustained arguments against the truth of trivialism.
According to this argument, trivialism cannot be true because it entails that every
observable state of affairs is contradictory - which is clearly not the case. After raising a
number of objections to this line of reasoning, I argue that a contradictory state of affairs
will necessarily appear consistent. As such, that the world appears consistent is not a
good reason for thinking that it fails to be contradictory.
In chapter 6 I defend the claim that the observable world is indeed contradictory in the
way that trivialism implies. I show that a dialetheic solution to Zeno’s paradox of the
arrow requires one to postulate that a body in motion is located at every point of the
path of its journey at every instant of the journey.

It never ceases to astound me that Graham Priest was willing to take this project
seriously enough to act as its supervisor – a clear demonstration of the philosophical
spirit. He was always attentive and thorough – and never short on criticism. Thanks
Graham. Thank you to my parents, Dave and Dale, for all the encouragement and

Introduction
It is a characteristic of humans that they are stingy in their dealings with reality (a fact
that is also reflected in their dealings with one another). Their sciences and logical
systems all seem to have in common the fact that they privilege off a certain class of
propositions as true – the rest are left to flounder as second class citizens. But Reality
does not so discriminate. Unlike humans, Being exhibits a generosity that is without
limit, and it will not allow itself to be contained by the rationings of mere humans. In
this thesis I argue for the truth of a claim that, to put it mildly, violates commonsense in
a way that no other philosophical theory to date has achieved. In this regard it even
surpasses Berkeley’s idealism or Lewis’s modal realism or the Indian philosophy of
Advaita Vedanta. I have in mind here the theory of trivialism.
Trivialism is the claim that every proposition is true. This is such a bizarre view that one
wonders why anyone would have taken an interest in it – let alone think that it is true.
The reason why there is an interest in trivialism is due to the fact that there has been a
revival in a view known as dialetheism - the claim that some contradictions are true.
Trivialism is often understood as an extreme form of dialetheism (all, as opposed to
some, contradictions are true). There has been pressure on dialetheists to distinguish
their own view from trivialism. There is no doubt that there is a tendency to conflate the
two. This dates back to Aristotle’s formulation and defense of the Law of NonContradiction in his Metaphysics Γ.
1 It is clear, given Aristotle’s intended target, that he is

1 Aristotle, The Metaphysics, 86-110. Although not everyone agrees that Aristotle is making a
mistake here. Berto, How to Sell a Contradiction, 279-80, argues that Aristotle was onto something
quite significant concerning the relationship between dialetheism and trivialism.
11
often defending the Law of Non-Triviality, i.e. the law that there is at least one
proposition that fails to be true. So, these passages are misunderstood if they are
interpreted to be an attack on dialetheism solely and not also trivialism. But the
temptation to conflate the two positions remains today. Priest reports that:
I often find myself being asked the following question: ‘Since you believe some
contradictions, but not all, you must have a criterion for deciding between those
that are true and those that are not. What is it?’2
According to Priest, the implication of such a query is that the questioner is unable to see
how the slippery slope toward trivialism can be avoided.
But, of course, there is a reason intrinsic to classical logic that is the probable source of
the accusation that dialetheism amounts to, or at least leads to, trivialism. In classical
logic, explosion is a valid form of inference, i.e. α, ¬α ├ β. Hence, if you hold there to be
a true contradiction (as the dialetheist does hold), then you are committed to trivialism.
It is clear then that if a dialetheist does not wish to be committed to trivialism, he/she
had better replace classical logic with an alternative system in which explosion fails to be
valid. Such systems have been extensively explored in the last fifty years or so and are
known as paraconsistent logics.3 It is arguably the case that the program has been
successful – so far at least. As far as I can see, one essential insight behind the program is
the realization that classical logic is mistaken in the way it understands negation.4

Priest, Doubt Truth to be a Liar, 56 (n).
3 An excellent primary document illustrating the early history of the program is the collection of
essays to be found in Priest, Routley & Norman, Paraconsistent Logic. But the program has grown
since then. Note also that the major proponents of the view claim that the program has ancient
roots – see the introductory essay by Priest & Routley, “Part 1: The History of Paraconsistent
Logic.”
4 A few points need to be kept in mind here. First is the realization that there has been in the
history of logic more than one theory of negation, with the classical account probably being the
12
Whatever the final details of a true theory of logic, some logicians are of the opinion that
it will be paraconsistent. All this shows that the dialetheist is right to insist that their
view be distinguished from trivialism.
But not everyone is convinced that a mere denial of the validity of explosion will suffice
to let the dialetheist off the charge of being a closet trivialist. Take the following
challenge from Kroon, who is a dialetheist himself:
Dialetheists … think that their rejection of ex contradictione quodlibet means that
they can’t be saddled with the claim that anything whatsoever is true … They
believe that there are true contradictions aplenty … but that such true
contradictions can be pretty well insulated from the rest of our beliefs. Of course,
they agree that logic can’t guarantee that there are not many more true
contradictions than just these; it can only tell us not to look to ‘laws’ like ex
contradictione quodlibet to generate this result. But this raises the question of how
they can defend the view that not everything is both true and false. In rejecting
the Law of Non-Contradiction, they can’t appeal to the incoherence of
something’s being both true and false, since they claim that some propositions,
indeed a substantial number of them, are both true and false. So what makes the
claim that everything is both true and false incoherent? (I assume without further
ado that it is incoherent – as flagrantly nonsensical as any claim could be).5

most recently developed, and the paraconsistent account arguably the earliest – see Routley &
Routley, “Negation and Contradiction.” Secondly, it would appear to be the case that the
paraconsistent account of negation is a more plausible account of how negation is actually used
in natural reasoning – see Routley & Routley “Negation and Contradiction.” Thirdly, it would
seem that it cannot be demonstrated that classical negation is coherent (i.e. its coherency will
always be an assumption rather than being rationally justified), and so it is epistemically possible
that classical logic is working with an incoherent notion of negation – see Priest, Doubt Truth to be
a Liar, 88-102. Finally, it would appear the classical logic confuses the notion of negation with
other distinct concepts such as the arrow falsum, and denial – see Priest, Doubt Truth to be a Liar,
85-6, 103-7.

 Kroon, “Realism and Dialetheism,” 245-6. In this particular paper Kroon argues for a most
unusual form of dialetheism (unusual compared to other forms of dialetheism), specifically nonrealist dialetheism. Kroon is of the opinion that the only way that a dialetheist can avoid the
possibility of trivialism is to either reject realism with respect to that part of our discourse that is
dialetheic or to give up dialetheism itself. Pitted against the trivialist, this is a rather weak
argument. After all, why think that trivialism is something to be avoided in the first place? Surely
Kroon needs independent reason here for avoiding a realist account of dialetheism.
13
As Kroon has pointed out, much of the rejection of trivialism has relied on a mere
pointing out that the inference of explosion (or ex contradictione quodlibet, ‘from a
contradiction anything’, as it is traditionally named) is invalid given the truth of
dialetheism. But even if the inference is invalid given a denial of the Law of NonContradiction, all this will show is that a particular argument for trivialism fails to be
sound – it does not show that there is reason for rejecting trivialism per se. The challenge
to the dialetheist is to find a reason for thinking that not every contradiction, and so
every proposition, is true. Almost no one has bothered to take up this challenge, so
entrenched is the view that trivialism is unacceptable. I know of only one exception –
Graham Priest – and I will be examining his objections to trivialism in various chapters
of the thesis.
A second issue requires addressing before heading into the main body of the thesis:
Surely the fact that trivialism violates commonsense to such a monumental degree
counts decisively against it. I agree that the fact that trivialism violates commonsense
counts against it. But I deny that the violation of commonsense is decisive. One might
keep in mind here the attitude of David Lewis in regard to his theory of modal realism
and the initial reactions to it.
The incredulous stare is a gesture meant to say that modal realism fails the test
[of compatibility with common sense]. That is a matter of judgment and, with
respect, I disagree. I acknowledge that my denial of common sense opinion is
severe, and I think it entirely right and proper to count that as a serious cost.
How serious is serious enough to be decisive? - That is our central question, yet I
don’t see how anything can be said about it. I still think the price is right, high as
it is … The theoretical benefits are worth it.6

I too will argue that there is reason to believe that trivialism is true, and in a way that I
think trumps commonsense. As such, I request of the reader that he or she put aside the
dictates of commonsense for a while and see where the arguments I present take you. I
hope to show that trivialism is not as bad as has been made out.
However, having said that, it seems to me that the relevant line to draw in such matters
is not between claims that are commonsense and claims that fail to be commonsense.
Rather, it is between what David Armstrong refers to as Moorean truths and nonMoorean truths (named after that champion of commonsense, G.E. Moore). David
Armstrong explores such a distinction in a recent article, and according to him, such
truths have two characteristics:
One mark of such truisms is that, in ordinary circumstances, it is embarrassing to
mention them … [a second mark is] the shallowness of truistic or Moorean
knowledge. Moorean Knowledge is vague and imprecise in many dimensions
and it takes us little way into the true nature of things.7
A case in point (one given by Armstrong and one that is important for the discussion in
chapter 6 of the thesis) is motion. That things move is a Moorean truth: it is so obvious
that it is embarrassing to even raise this as an example of knowledge, and it is a very
superficial claim about the world. It is superficial in the sense that we are no nearer the
correct analysis of the nature of motion than Zeno was two-thousand years ago.8 The

7 Armstrong, “The Scope and Limits of Human Knowledge,” 159, 160-1.
8 Although I know that many philosophers might disagree with this claim and wish to insist that
their preferred account of motion is the correct one and that there is no room for dispute on the
issue. I use this example because it is one used by Armstrong himself. If you do not like this
particular example, then there are plenty of others that you can choose from, e.g. the nature of
time (is time B-theoretic or A-theoretic?), the existence of God (does he exist or not?), the nature
of vagueness (is it merely epistemic or is it semantic?) etc.
15
question of what motion actually consists in is an ongoing and most fascinating
philosophical problem. But the banality of motion itself remains.
I seriously doubt that the claim that trivialism ought to be rejected can be considered a
Moorean truth. The average man or woman has given no thought at all about the issue
of whether everything might be true. It is not the kind of thing they would consider
when getting about the business of living in the world. There is no guarantee that upon
reflection the average man would side with any one who rejected trivialism, once they
have considered the relevant arguments. Indeed, one of the implications of the case that
I make is that one can go about the business of everyday living and be a trivialist (see
chapter 4, for example).
But neither would I classify the consensus view concerning trivialism (that is to say,
nontrivialism) as being among that other part of human knowledge, namely well
established mathematical and scientific truths. In saying this I am not denying that it is
part of well established mathematics and logic that trivialism plays a role in the method
of proof – usually in the form of argument known as reductio ad absurdum (the idea being
that a proposition or set of propositions is to be rejected if it entails trivialism). What I
am contending is that nontrivialism is part of what Armstrong calls belief that is more or
less justified and he places all of philosophy in this category, including presumably any
thesis about trivialism.9 The point of mentioning all this about Moorean truths is that
one should never overplay the significance of commonsense. All we should really be

16
worried about is whether a philosophical position can be justified with argument – and I
think that trivialism can be.
One final issue that might be playing on the reader’s mind: what on earth bought me to
seriously consider trivialism in the first place? There are four factors that have driven
my investigation of trivialism. First, a defense of trivialism just might fill what I see to be
a major lacuna in the defense of various logical theories and claims. Two examples come
to mind here: the theory of dialetheism, and the inference of contraction. At least some
of the resistance to dialetheism comes from what is perceived to be the inadequacies in
the various attempts to develop a paraconsistent logic. Take this quote from Littmann,
for example:
There are a number of logics which are not explosive. A system is explosive if
within that system, the truth of a contradiction entails the truth of every
sentence. Classical logic is explosive. If a system of logic is not explosive, it is
called a “paraconsistent logic”. Obviously, dialetheism is going to be a much less
attractive view if there are no satisfactory systems of paraconsistent logic. After
all, the truth of dialetheism would require the truth of every theory, which is an
infinitely expensive requirement.10
It is Littmann’s view that there are no adequate systems of paraconsistent logic currently
available, and so it is unlikely that dialetheism is able to avoid entailing trivialism.11 One
obvious response the dialetheist could make to this is to defend one of the current
systems of paraconsistent logic from objections made to it, or develop a system that does
work. But an alternative method would be to show that, contra Littmann, trivialism is

10 Littmann, “A Critique of Dialetheism,” 7.
11 Or at least there are no adequate systems of paraconsistent logic at the time that Littmann
wrote his thesis – see Littmann, “A Critique of Dialetheism,” ch. 2. I am uncertain if Littmann has
changed his view on this given more recent developments. See Littmann and Simmons, “A
Critique of Dialetheism” for more recent evidence that he has not changed his mind.
17
not an “... infinitely expensive requirement.”12 A defense of trivialism should therefore
figure in any defense of dialetheism. After all, there is no guarantee that logicians will
come up with a system of paraconsistency that satisfies everyone.
Similar things could be said about the inference of contraction: p→p→q├ p→q. Despite
the inference being intuitively valid (I have had it described to me as being like a
stutter), there have been attempts to develop logics without contraction. This is because
one can use the inference to prove the truth of any sentence. I will have more to say
about this inference in chapter 2, section 3, when I discuss the use of the Curry Paradox
as a proof for trivialism. But for now it is important to note that one way to defend the
validity of this inference is to show that there is nothing really problematic about
trivialism.
Secondly, most of my philosophical interests are driven by what may be referred to as
the big cosmological or metaphysical questions13: Why is there something rather than
nothing? Why does the world appear designed and contrived? There are a range of answers to
these questions around today, including both naturalistic and super-naturalistic
accounts.14 But it occurred to me that trivialism should be included among such views,

12 Littmann, “A Critique of Dialetheism,” 7.
13 I am aware that there are philosophers who take the position that questions of this sort are
largely non-starters and pseudo-questions (see for example Grünbaum, “The Poverty of Theistic
Cosmology.”) I have some sympathy for this view and so it might be that my interest in such
questions is largely a hang-over from certain cultural and emotional dispositions (inherited from
a Catholic up-bringing perhaps) rather than rational considerations.
14 Some naturalistic accounts include Smith, “Time was Created by a Timeless Point”; Smith,
“Kalam Cosmological Arguments for Atheism”; Smith, “Big Bang Cosmology and Atheism”;
Smolin, The Life of the Cosmos; Unger, “Minimizing Arbitrariness.” Two well known theistic
accounts are Craig, The Kalam Cosmological Argument; and Swinburne, Is there a God?
18
although it defies classification under the categories naturalism/supernaturalism (it
does after all entail both). Trivialism answers some of the big cosmological questions in
a manner that avoids the standard replies: Why is there something rather than nothing?
Because trivialism is true and trivialism entails that there is something rather than
nothing. Why does the world appear to be designed? Because trivialism is true and trivialism
entails that the world is designed.15 It is not hard to see that trivialism has going for it
the epistemic virtue of simplicity. It postulates an entity known as a proposition and a
property known as truth (both of which are widely, although not universally, accepted),
and asserts: ∀pTp is true. You cannot get simpler than that. In addition, trivialism
would appear to be far less arbitrary than nontrivialism (the claim that only some, but
not all, propositions are true). A problem arises for the nontrivialist that does not arise
for the trivialist: if only some propositions are true, then which ones? And of course, this
generates all the epistemological and skeptical problems surrounding the issue of how
one knows that one has designated the correct propositions as true. By holding all
propositions to be true, the trivialist bypasses the problems of skepticism and the
attendant need for an epistemology. There is no special class of propositions (the ones
that are true) and so no need to justify the exact membership of this class over some
other characterization of its membership. But is trivialism true? Well, it is the task of this
thesis to show that it is.

15 Of course, trivialism will also entail that there is nothing rather than something and it entails
that the world is not designed. The reader may suspect that this counts against trivialism being
an acceptable answer to the big cosmological questions – ‘it entails all the right things, but it
entails all the wrong things as well!’ I will explain in chapter 3 why I do not think this is a sound
objection to trivialism.
19
Thirdly, it seems to me that trivialism may have the potential to ground a non-theistic
concept of deity. There has been an intuition expressed by a minority of thinkers, from a
wide range of religious traditions, that the only acceptable account of God is one in
which he is portrayed as the greatest possible or conceivable being. In many quarters of
contemporary analytic philosophy of religion, it is taken for granted that the concept of a
being of which no greater is conceivable goes hand in hand with classical theism. I am of
the opinion that it fits much better with something more like trivialism. I will explore
this theme in more detail in chapter 3, but for now I wish to draw attention to the idea
that if trivialism is true, then reality consists of the greatest possible totality – a totality
so inclusive that it includes everything, even its opposite. That the ultimate or God is to
be understood in this manner can be illustrated by the following passage taken from the
second century C.E. Gnostic text, The Secret Book of John:
The One is a sovereign that has nothing over it … It does not exist within
anything that is inferior to it, since everything exists only within it. It is eternal
since it does not need anything. For it is absolutely complete: it has never lacked
anything in order to be complete … It is illimitable, since there is nothing before
it to limit it.16
That God is to be understood in some sense as an all inclusive entity is a sentiment
expressed much later in the fifteenth century by Nicholas of Cusa:
And it is not, as well as is, all that which is conceived to be; and it is, as well is
not, all that which is conceived not to be. But it is a given thing in such way that
it is all things; and it is all things in such way that it is no thing; and it is
maximally a given thing in such a way that it is it minimally. For example, to say
“God, who is Absolute Maximality, is light” [is to say] not other than “God is
maximally light in such a way that He is minimally light.”17

16 Meyer, The Secret Teachings of Jesus, 56-7.
17 Hopkins, Nicholas of Cusa on Learned Ignorance, 51-2.
20
Of course, such conceptions of deity have always been controversial, but I hope in this
thesis to show that there is at least some philosophical plausibility to them, even if the
theology that emerges from these is found to be questionably.18 There are religious
prospects offered by trivialism other than a concept of God. In the conclusion to chapter
4 I suggest that trivialism can be the basis for a religious pursuit that has more in
common with religions in which the ultimate goal is the dissolution of the self –
religions such as Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta. In the conclusion I make suggestions
as to how trivialism may contribute to a life characterized by that ancient Greek virtue of
ataraxia. The point of emphasizing such religious and ethical prospects is to show that
the truth of trivialism is far from being an esoteric subject of interest to logicians only.
Rather, it has the potential to be of great existential import.
Finally, I hope that trivialism can contribute to the development of philosophy much in
the same way that skepticism has.19 Ever since its conception in classical Greece,
skepticism has served to stimulate the development of sophisticated theories of
epistemology and high-minded reflections on the nature of philosophy. Few have

18 For a very recent critique of such conceptions of deity see Craig, “Pantheists in Spite of
themselves.”
19 Indeed, a comparison between trivialism and skepticism reveals interesting symmetries
between the two views. If we understand the trivialist to be someone who believes everything
and the skeptic who believes nothing, we can see that skepticism is the opposite of trivialism.
Indeed, Priest has noted that one of the main arguments against the skeptic (that he cannot act in
a purposeful or discriminating manner) can also be leveled at the trivialist – see his “Could
Everything be True?” I will examine such objections to trivialism in chapter 4 of the thesis. There
is, interestingly enough, a version of trivialism that has the trivialist also believing nothing. This
is a version which takes for granted the so-called cancellation view of negation. On this account
of negation, trivialism will have no content, as every sentence and its negation is true, and
negation serves to cancel the content of a sentence. Thus the trivialist is left believing nothing at
all. I will not be defending this version of trivialism in this thesis. Rather, I will take it for granted
that trivialism has total content (but, of course, that it has total content will entail that it also has
null content).
21
accepted the conclusions of the skeptic, and in their rush to refute the arguments of the
skeptic, philosophical history has been made. Indeed, one wonders whether there would
even be a discipline and pursuit like philosophy if it were not for the catalyst of skeptical
thought (would Plato have composed his Theaetetus, for instance, or Hegel his
Phenomenology of Spirit if it were not for the skeptical challenge?). I would like to think
that trivialism could play a similar role: even if it is rejected as the basis for an account of
God and the world, I hope it could inspire those who are repulsed by it to develop
concepts and arguments of great beauty and sophistication in order to refute it.
Certainly I would like to think that the responses that are made to this thesis are more
sophisticated than the current arguments against trivialism are. May the next stage in
the history of philosophy be a reaction to trivialism. To that end, a summary of the
thesis follows.

Chapter 1: The History of Trivialism
After outlining what has been and is currently the dominant and prevailing opinion
concerning trivialism (a view that amounts to a denial of trivialism), I inquire into
whether there has been or are any supporters of trivialism. I explore a range of thinkers
and traditions in this regard: various Pre-Socratic philosophers (Anaximander,
Anaxagoras, and Heraclitus); Nicholas of Cusa; Spinoza; Hua-Yen Buddhism; and
Hegel. I conclude that although there are elements and ideas from such thinkers and
traditions that suggest a trivialist interpretation, it would be unwise to conclude they are
in fact examples of trivialists – none of them explicitly claim that every proposition is
true, for example (although some come close to this). There are trivialists on the
22
contemporary philosophical scene – myself (or at least the persona from which I am
writing) and Jodie Azzouni. I provide a brief outline of Azzouni’s efforts at articulating
and defending trivialism. The rest of the thesis is an outline of my own account and
defense of trivialism.
Chapter 2: Arguments for Trivialism
In this chapter I begin defending the truth of trivialism. To this end, I examine various
deductive style arguments for the truth of trivialism: the explosive liar; the Curry
Paradox; an argument from the Characterization Principle; an argument from
possibilism; and an argument from a trivial entity. I show that only the first of these is
obviously unsound. The other four, however, are arguably sound and so give good
reason for thinking that trivialism is true. On the other hand I am willing to concede that
such arguments may fail to be dialectically useful, as they are based on premises or
inferences that might reasonably be rejected by someone wishing to resist the claim that
trivialism is true. But this seems to me to be a small loss when it is remembered that
there are few if any arguments in philosophy that can succeed, in the sense of satisfying
everyone. For any given philosophical argument one can always resist its persuasive
power by refusing to believe a crucial premise. Trivialism is no worse off than any other
philosophical theory in this regard.
Chapter 3: On the Impossibility of the Denial of Trivialism
This chapter provides additional reason, to those developed in chapter 2, for committing
oneself to trivialism. In this chapter I argue that the denial of trivialism is impossible –
and so one cannot avoid committing to it in some sense. In a sense we have no option
23
but to accept trivialism. After developing an account of what I mean by the denial of
some view (a view is denied by asserting an alternative view), I then show that it is not
possible to deny trivialism, as there is no alternative view to trivialism that one can
assert. I then spell out two important implications of this conclusion: that the denial of
trivialism is at best irrational; that at very worst the trivialist has no opponent who
disputes her view, and so in the debate between the trivialist and the nontrivialist, the
trivialist wins by default – there is literally no such thing as the nontrivialist. I then
examine a possible response from the nontrivialist. This response is centered upon an
alternative account of denial. On this account denial cannot be reduced to a form of
assertion – it is, rather, a sui generis speech act. It would seem that one could deny
trivialism given this account of denial. I respond to this in two ways. First, I suggest
reasons for thinking that this is not a plausible account of denial. Secondly, even if it is a
plausible account of denial that enables one to deny trivialism, it still remains the case
that there is nothing that one could assert that amounts to the performance of the speech
act of nontrivialism, and so nothing one can believe that would qualify one as a
nontrivialist.
Chapter 4: Is it Possible to Believe in Trivialism?
Some of the most ancient analyses of trivialism have concerned not the truth of
trivialism but the question of whether it is even possible to believe that it is true. This
chapter analyses the various arguments for the claim that it is impossible to believe in
trivialism.
24
The first recorded attempt to show that trivialism is impossible to believe is to be found
in Aristotle’s Metaphysics Γ.
20 According to Aristotle, if one were to believe everything,
then one could never act in a discriminating manner. That is to say, the trivialist could
not choose action x over action y because of reason z, as the trivialist believes that either
course of action is equally as good for achieving z.
More recently, Priest has argued that if one were to believe everything, then one could
not even form a purpose to act. The trivialist believes that every state of affairs obtains,
and so could not form the intention of bringing about a state of affairs. But it would
seem that purposeful behavior is unavoidable for any conscious being. So, one cannot be
a trivialist.
In this chapter I suggest three responses a trivialist might make to such arguments. The
first response I make to Aristotle is to take up a suggestion made by Priest. According to
Priest, Aristotle fails to take into account that belief is not sufficient to account for an
action – desire must also be taken into account. Accordingly, a trivialist may not have
the desire to undertake many actions even if they have the requisite beliefs. My first
response to Priest involves suggesting a different account of action that diverges slightly
from the orthodox account in terms of belief and desire or intention. I suggest ways in
which a trivialist may act despite not actually having any desire or intentions. I also
show how one might become a trivialist over a period of time such that one maintains
certain purposes for acting despite believing everything.

20 Aristotle, The Metaphysics, 96-7.
25
In the second response, rather than critique the arguments of Priest and Aristotle, I offer
an alternative account of what it means to be a trivialist – an account that avoids the
difficulties raised by these critics. It is suggested that all that is required of someone to
be a trivialist is that they believe the proposition, ‘all propositions are true’, and
everything else they believe is either entailed by this sentence or at least compatible with
it. Of course, every proposition is entailed by trivialism, and so it is rather easy to
qualify as a trivialist on this account.
The third response takes up the Humean idea that to have a belief is merely to have a
greater degree (relative to an imagination) of affection toward a mental object. I show
how this might enable the trivialist who believes each and every proposition to act in
both a discriminating and purposeful manner. The idea is that the trivialist might very
well have varying degrees of affection toward objects of belief that enable discrimination
and purposeful action to take place.
I conclude the chapter by suggesting that there is still a role for trivialism to play in both
a philosophical and religious context even if the arguments presented by Priest and
Aristotle are sound.
Chapter 5: Is it Possible to Observe a Contradictory State of Affairs?
I begin this chapter by spelling out one of the few attempts made by advocates of the
consensus view to explain why trivialism is to be rejected. Graham Priest presents an a
posteriori argument in response to this question. The idea is something like this: if
26
trivialism were true, then every perceptual observation would be contradictory; but it is
not – our perceptual experiences are overwhelmingly consistent.
As I argue in chapter 3, the dialectical context in which Priest is trying to define his
defense is not even assertable, as there is no such position as a rejection of trivialism.
Any observation we have of the world is part of the content of trivialism. The argument
then cannot be used to perform the speech act of the denial of trivialism. But even as an
argument to show that the observable world is consistent, I believe that it fails for
independent reasons. I argue that if there were a contradictory state of affairs, it would
necessarily (given the nature of a contradiction) appear consistent. As such, the
appearance of consistency is equally evidence for a contradictory state of affairs as it is
for a consistent state of affairs.21
Chapter 6: Zeno’s Arrow Paradox and the Contradictory Nature of the World
This chapter examines an argument that is not in support of trivialism per se, but rather
in support of what might be termed physical trivialism or near trivialism. The idea is
that the physical world is deeply contradictory. By assuming that there is such a thing as
an instantaneous state of motion, I reach this conclusion by developing a dialetheic
solution to Zeno’s Paradox of the Arrow. The basic idea is that for any body in motion
over an interval from A to B, the body in question is located at every point of the interval
at every instant of the journey. This, of course, gives rise to an obvious objection: If this
is the case, then why do we not observe such contradictory states of affairs. I provide an

21 Much of this chapter has been published as Kabay, “When Seeing is not Believing.”
27
answer to that objection in chapter 5 above. I also discuss various other objections to this
argument.
Given that there are arguments for thinking that the physical world is trivial, the step to
an absolute version of trivialism (in which every proposition and not merely every
proposition about the physical world is true) is not as unintuitive as it might have
been.22
Conclusion
I bring the thesis to a conclusion by reflecting on the possible existential implications of
trivialism in addition to the comments made in the conclusion of chapter 4. I suggest
parallels between a trivialist way of life and that of the skeptic in order to illustrate how
trivialism might contribute to the ancient Greek project of achieving ataraxia. I end by
drawing attention to the philosophical value of undertaking a project of this sort.
A Note on Dialectic
In this thesis I take on the persona of a trivialist. That is to say, it is written from the
perspective of one who holds all things to be true and is seeking to convince others of

22 Of course, this is not to say that the biggest problem facing trivialism is the inconsistency of the
empirical world. Indeed an opponent may think that this is the least of its problems. Trivialism
entails things that are probably even more controversial. Take these examples: ‘the number three
is a concrete object’ or ‘1+1=56’. This, of course, assumes that such examples are genuine
propositions and not merely nonsense. It is always open to the trivialist to reject a certain
sentence as not expressing a genuine proposition. But this would require independent argument
in cases such as the two examples given, as they appear to express a genuine proposition even if
they are in fact quite bizarre.
28
this. As a trivialist I accept as true every premise of every argument in the thesis. But
note also that I accept the negation of each and every premise of these arguments.
But the tone of many of the arguments I present may seem puzzling in light of my
acceptance of every proposition. It would seem that I am trying to get my opponent to
accept some premises over others, for example. But it might seem from this that I accept
some propositions over others. Many of the arguments I present have to be understood
as being ad hominem in nature. That is to say, they are aimed at a particular audience. In
presenting such arguments I am attempting to push the members of that audience into
seeing that given their commitments they really should be trivialist as well.
Once a person has been convinced of the truth of trivialism, however, these arguments
become rather superfluous from the perspective of the trivialist. After all, such a person
asserts the truth of any given proposition directly without having to arrive at that
proposition through some chain of reasoning. However, like the persona representing
the author of this thesis, they may wish to use these arguments to convince others of
trivialism. The thesis then is not entirely the proverbial ladder that one kicks away upon
having arrived at the top.23 Having said that, let us begin.

23 Cf. Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus 6.54.
29
Chapter 1: A History of Trivialism
1. What is Trivialism and what do people think of it?
I define trivialism as the claim that each and every proposition is true, i.e. ∀pTp. For
example, if trivialism is true, then a whole host of propositions that no one would think
twice about are true – ‘Australia is a constitutional monarchy’; ‘1+1=2’; ‘The First Fleet
arrived in Botany Bay in 1788’; ‘the hydrogen atom has exactly one proton in its
nucleus’; and ‘trivialism is false’. But, of course, if trivialism is true, then the negations of
each of these are also true. Indeed, even propositions such as the following are true:
‘nothing is identical to itself’; ‘two physical objects can occupy the same place at the
same time’; and ‘a body can be colored red all over and green all over’. I define a
trivialist as someone who asserts or believes the truth of each and every proposition.24 I
define nontrivialism as the denial of trivialism. I define the nontrivialist as someone who
denies that every proposition is true, that is to say, denies that trivialism is true. Note
that I have defined nontrivialism in terms of the performance of a speech act –
specifically, the speech act of denial. This has important implications for the very
possibility of nontrivialism, and I will discuss this in chapter three along with alternative
notions of what it is to be a nontrivialist.

24 In chapter 4, where I consider arguments against the possibility of being able to believe in
trivialism, I will consider the need for alternative definitions of ‘trivialist’ in order to reply to such
arguments. Specifically, I will suggest the following alternative definition of trivialist: a trivialist is
someone who at the very least believes the sentence ‘∀’pTp’. On this definition all the beliefs of such a
person are entailed by trivialism, but they do not necessarily believe every proposition entailed
by trivialism.
30
Now it should be pointed out here that my definition of trivialism assumes that the truth
predicate obeys unrestricted capture and release (i.e. p↔Tp). Indeed, I think that this is
obviously assumed by all the opponents of trivialism, and is the reason why trivialism is
thought to be so problematic. One can envisage a sort of disingenuous defense of
trivialism, in which either the release or capture of the truth predicate is restricted, in an
attempt to make it more palatable. A version of trivialism in which the release of the
truth predicate is restricted would enable the trivialist to avoid what are thought to be
the most unintuitive consequences of trivialism. For example, such a trivialist might be
quite happy to assert that it is true that 1+1=3 (after all, she believes that all propositions
are true). But she might very well fail to assert that 1+1=3. That is to say such a trivialist
denies that Tp├p, where p is ‘1+1=3’. It should be realized that I will not make use of
such a strategy in this thesis, and there are two very good reasons for this. First, such a
defense would be something of a straw-man. Such a form of trivialism is not really
trivialism at all given the parameters of the debate – no one is really attacking such a
view. Secondly, that this is a more plausible or intuitive version of trivialism is perhaps
greatly exaggerated. The fact is that the idea that the truth predicate fails to behave
according to unrestricted release is very odd indeed. A defense of this kind of trivialism
would be difficult and certainly beyond my ken. Having made clear then the relevant
definitions, it is time to say a little about what people think of this view.
There is a consensus among philosophers concerning the topic of trivialism. It can be
described as nontrivialism, i.e. the denial of trivialism. Nontrivialism is well represented
(or at least thought to be well represented – I will show in chapter 3 that this is not so) by
the following quote:
31
It is important to distinguish between two positions. The first is that some
contradictions are true – dialetheism; the second is that everything, and a fortiori,
every contradiction is true – trivialism … a substantial case can be made for the
first; belief in the second, though, would appear to be grounds for certifiable
insanity.25
Some comments concerning trivialism are so strongly and negatively worded that you
would never think that an intelligent or even sane person would advocate such a
metaphysic. Take the following example:
What makes the claim that everything is both true and false incoherent? (I
assume without further ado that it is incoherent – as flagrantly nonsensical as
any claim could be) … the thought that the truth of trivialism is a genuine open
possibility … ought to strike us as bizarre and intolerable. Unlike other
incredible doctrines, it deserves not an incredulous stare, but no stare at all. It is
not even a starter for a stare.26
More restrained but similarly skeptical is the position taken in a recent introduction to
logic. The authors strongly advise the dialetheist to ensure that they develop an
alternative to classical logic so as to avoid a contradiction from implying the truth of
every proposition:
A dialetheist should … make sure that his or her system of logic does not have
such a feature, or else every statement would be true according to the system. It
is hard to imagine why anyone would want to embrace such systems, for to
accept every statement as true is to give up reasoning indeed, and most likely
with disastrous practical consequences.27
Or take the view of Bueno – perhaps the most restrained expression of nontrivialism
ever:

25 Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions,” 443.
26 Kroon, “Realism and Dialetheism,” 252-3. Kroon is, of course, alluding to David Lewis’s
famous retort that opponents of modal realism do not have good reasons for rejecting modal
realism – at best they offer an incredulous stare. See Lewis, On the Plurality of Worlds, 133.
27 Brennan, Deutsch, Lau, Logic: Key Concepts in Philosophy, 158.
32
Trivialism isn’t the sort of philosophical view one would arrive at easily. In fact,
until very recently, it’s a view that hardly anyone would even take very
seriously. An incredulous stare would seem enough to dispose of it.28
These sentiments toward trivialism are largely ubiquitous. Philosophers and logicians
would seem to agree that nontrivialism is the only rational and live option when it
comes to a choice between trivialism and nontrivialism.
2. The Pre-Socratics
It is not surprising that trivialism is the least advocated of worldviews. But there are
some who have thought that there have existed trivialists in the past – as doubtful as this
might be. Although he does not actually use the word ‘trivialism’, Aristotle, in his
Metaphysics Γ, seems to have thought that Heraclitus and Anaxagoras both advocated
trivialism – an interpretation which is, more likely than not, incorrect.29 Certainly I know
of no modern commentator who would agree with this view of either Heraclitus or
Anaxagoras. Although, having said that, I can understand why Aristotle may have come
to such a conclusion. Although I doubt that they are trivialists, there are aspects to their
thought that suggest that at times they might be thinking in that direction – and this is
especially so of Anaxagoras. According to Anaxagoras “All things were together.”30
Here is one account of just how inclusive Anaxagoras is being with the term ‘all’:
His own original mixture must contain, not only the traditional opposites (of
which hot and cold are Anaximander’s, the wet and the dry are also his or
possibly added from Heraclitus, while the bright and the dark are presumably …
Pythagorean …), nor only the Empedoclean elements (… exemplified by earth,

28 Bueno, “Troubles with Trivialism,” 655.
29 See Aristotle, The Metaphysics, 107-8.
30 Kirk & Raven, The Presocratic Philosophers, 368.
33
… air and aither (or fire) …); it must contain also ‘innumerable seeds in no way
like each other’.31
This last reference to the seeds is very suggestive of all contradictions being true of that
which is the ultimate source of reality. But again, other than the fact that Aristotle
interprets him in this manner, there is no independent reason to prefer this
interpretation over an alternative – for example, that the various elements of reality are
well mixed up, yet consistent.
The writings of Heraclitus are also in some ways suggestive of trivialism. The fragments
that are most relevant for our purposes here are those that express what has come to be
known as the doctrine of the unity of opposites. That this is to be understood as a belief,
on the part of Heraclitus, in dialetheism (the claim that at least some contradictions are
true) is controversial. Most commentators seem to hold that it is an expression of the
organic unity of all things, rather than the belief in the truth of explicit contradictions.32
However, it is at least possible to interpret the doctrine in this dialetheic manner, and
that it should be so interpreted receives additional support from the fact that Aristotle
understood it in this way (he does after all formulate the Law of Non-Contradiction in
Metaphysics Γ in response to thinkers such as Heraclitus). The following fragments are
good examples:
Cold warms up, warm cools off, moist parches, dry dampens.33

31 See Kirk & Raven, The Presocratic Philosophers, 369-70.
32 Kirk & Raven, The Presocratic Philosophers, holds this position as does Kahn, The Thought of
Heraclitus, 192 (nn. 249-50) and n. 349. But Kahn seems to contradict himself on this point – see
the commentary (point (3)) on fragment CXVIII on pages 270-1.
33 Kahn, The Thought of Heraclitus, 53.
34
One cannot step twice into the same river, nor can one grasp any mortal
substance in a stable condition, but it scatters and again gathers; it forms and
dissolves, and approaches and departs. Or rather, not again nor later but at the same
time it forms and dissolves, and approaches and departs.
34
It rests by changing.35
The way up and down is one and the same.36
Graspings: wholes and not wholes, convergent divergent, consonant dissonant,
from all things one and from one thing all.37
One can glean, I guess, from such fragments why someone like Aristotle would interpret
Heraclitus as being trivialist or at least a dialetheist of an extreme sort. But again this is
hardly decisive evidence.
Anaxagoras’ predecessor Anaximander also says some things that might be interpreted
as being a form of trivialism. If this interpretation is correct (and I am far from sure that
it is) then this makes trivialism one of the first non-mythological accounts of reality.
Anaximander attempted to provide a theory of everything that possessed explanatory
value and appealed to religious sensibilities.38 Fleshing out the ideas of any thinker from
this period in history is a difficult task, but a plausible account of Anaximander, pieced
together by scholars from a range of sources, goes something like this.39 There is an
entity, referred to by Anaximander as the apeiron, which is the basis of all reality in the
sense that all of reality is derived in some sense from it. The apeiron is characterized

Kahn holds to be inauthentic.

35
(indeed this is the translation of the word) as being indefinite and infinite. There is some
controversy among both ancient and modern commentators concerning the sense in
which it is indefinite and infinite.40 However, a plausible reading is that apeiron is
indefinite in kind, meaning that it is no single kind of thing, rather “… it resembled no
one kind of matter in the developed world.”41
Anaximander is therefore to be distinguished from his Milesian contemporary, Thales,
who was of the opinion that water was the basis of all reality. Anaximander is therefore
not a monist, as Thales and his successor Anaximenes (who claimed that air is the
fundamental basis for all reality), or at least not in the same sense of the word (we can
perhaps understand the apeiron as being a unity that happens to be all-inclusive). But is
Anaximander a trivialist? Certain aspects to his thought are very suggestive in this
regard. The idea that the apeiron is no single kind of thing might be interpreted as the
apeiron being all things.42 The inclusiveness of the apeiron supposedly extends to
opposites43, and this is suggestive of a trivial entity. As with Anaxagoras and Heraclitus,
none of this is at all conclusive reason for thinking that Anaximander is trivialist. At
most one can say that the textual material is suggestive in this regard.

42 Of course, another interpretation is that aperion is a kind of nothing, i.e. it has no properties as
opposed to all properties.

3. Nicholas of Cusa
Also of interest in a history of trivialism is the fifteenth century Cardinal, Nicholas of
Cusa or Cusanus. Until now Cusanus was the thinker who came closest to advocating
trivialism. He is on record as claiming, in his De Docta Ignorantia, that in God all
contradictories coincide.44 This has been taken by some to be equivalent to the claim that
God is a trivial object i.e. that every predicate is true of God or God has every property.45
If this interpretation of Cusanus is correct then this is sufficient for him to qualify as a
trivialist: if there is a trivial being, then one of the things true of it is that it exists in a
world in which trivialism is true. I am far from certain that this is what Cusanus
intended to mean (even if it is logically entailed by his various commitments), and I
know of no reputable Cusan scholar who would advocate such an interpretation.46 I am
unsure how to interpret him, as he makes little effort to clarify his views. Having noted
that, it should be kept in mind that such scholars (i.e. those who reject that Cusanus is
trivialist) should not cite as evidence for denying he was a trivialist the fact that Cusanus
was an advocate of Aristotelian logic and the Law of Non-Contradiction.47 This is
because an advocacy of both Aristotelian logic and the law of Non-Contradiction are
quite compatible with being a trivialist – the trivialist accepts the truth of all
propositions, including the Law of Non-Contradiction and other laws of Aristotelian
logic.

44 Hopkins, Nicholas of Cusa on Learned Ignorance, 158.
45 Priest, Beyond the Limits of Thought, 23; and Littmann, “A Critique of Dialetheism,” 3.
46 Most Cusan Scholars place Nicholas in the Christian Neo-Platonic tradition – see, for example,
Miller, Reading Cusanus, vii.
47 See, for example, his Apologia Doctae Ignorantiae, 15.
37
It is possible that commentators resist an interpretation of Cusanus (and, indeed,
Anaxagoras or Heraclitus) as making contradictory claims about reality because they
take classical logic for granted.48 The reasoning might go something like this: “a sensible
thinker would not make contradictory claims about reality because contradictions are
clearly false; now Cusanus or Anaxagoras or Heraclitus are clearly likely to be sensible
sorts of fellows, so any passages of theirs that seem to be making contradictory claims
need to be reinterpreted to say what a sensible fellow would say.” Clearly this kind of
reasoning is question begging on at least two fronts: maybe Cusanus, Anaxagoras, and
Heraclitus were not sensible fellows, or maybe contradictions can be true. But I think
that this is a common way in which many modern philosophers have read the history of
western philosophy. The dominance of the idea that the Law of Non-Contradiction is
beyond dispute leads them to interpret this commitment into past thinkers who may
have been straightforwardly dialetheist or even trivialist.49
4. Spinoza
One might also wish to mention Spinoza in the construction of a history of trivialism. It
might be tempting to argue that he is a trivialist given his commitment to the claim that
there is only one substance (Deus siva Natura) and that this substance has infinitely many
attributes (of which extension and thought are only two).50 These attributes in turn

48 See Kirk & Raven 1957, 367-8 for a sound critique of this tendency.
49 Such a reading of history is also driven by the assumption that all versions of the LNC are
incompatible with dialetheism and trivialism. But this is arguably not the case. See Berto,
“Material Exclusion,” and chapter 3 of this thesis for an account of why the LNC is not
necessarily incompatible with dialetheism and trivialism.
50 See Ethics, I. ‘Of God’.
38
exhibit various modes, which are the individual objects of our experience. Certain
passages, such as Proposition 16 of Book 1, are suggestive of a trivialist worldview:
From the necessity of the divine nature there must follow infinitely many things
in infinitely many modes, (i.e. everything which can fall under an infinite
intellect).51
Whether we can interpret Spinoza as a trivialist will depend, in part, on how we
understand his claim that the one substance has infinitely many attributes. There is
uncertainty over whether by ‘infinite’ he meant merely all possible attributes (and these
are exhausted by thought and extension), or whether he meant that the number of
attributes is greater than any finite number.52
Of course, one might object to this trivialist interpretation of Spinoza by pointing out
that he had a strong commitment to the Law of Non-Contradiction. There are passages
where he seems to dismiss the truth of sentences that are of the form ‘p and it is not the
case that p’ (for example, see Ethics IP11, II/53). Three responses can be made to this
point. First, it might very well be that Spinoza rules out the possibility of a true
contradiction because of the notion of negation that he presupposes. It may very well
have been that he was only familiar with a cancellation view of negation in which
negating a sentence will cancel out the content of that sentence. If he had known of

51 Spinoza, Ethics, 13.
52 Bennett, “Spinoza’s metaphysics,” 65-6. See also Bennett, A Study of Spinoza’s Ethics, 75-9.
Although Bennett seems to take it as a serious possibility that Spinoza thinks there is only two
attributes, others take it as obvious that he thinks there are more than two – see for example
Curley, Behind the Geometrical Method, 64-5, 154n17. It should be noted that Bennett, nor any other
commentator, interprets Spinoza as trivialist even given the required reading of ‘infinite’.
39
alternative theories such as paraconsistent and relevant notions of negation, then he may
have been more sympathetic to the possibility that a contradiction can be true.53
Secondly, Spinoza makes it clear that there is far more to reality than we could ever hope
to have access to. Of God or Nature’s infinite attributes we have access to only two –
thought and extension. It seems to me that with respect to at least some of these
attributes (excluding thought and extension), contradictions might be true of them. The
fact is that Spinoza holds that there is one-one correlation between ideas and objects.
Given that there is an idea of a contradiction, it would follow that there is a
contradictory object in some attribute of God. Of course, if Spinoza was committed to a
cancellation view of negation, then he might not have thought that there is an idea of a
contradiction (such a thing on the usual understanding of this view of negation has no
content).
Thirdly, as with my comments concerning Cusanus on this same issue, it would appear
that the truth of the Law of Non-Contradiction is quite compatible with the truth of
trivialism (the trivialist, after all, accepts every proposition). Logically speaking,
Spinoza’s commitment to this law does not require an explanation given a trivialist
reading of him, because the trivialist accepts everything.
Having said all that, it seems to me that Spinoza’s concept of attribute is
straightforwardly inconsistent anyway – and this is despite what Spinoza might think.

53 See Routley and Routley, “Negation and Contradiction” for a discussion of such alternative
views of negation.
40
To hold that the infinite attributes of substance are distinct and yet each constitutes the
essence of substance (Ethics, ID4) is a violation of the Law of Non-Contradiction if ever
there was one. But, once again, at most one can say is that various claims of Spinoza are
suggestive of trivialism. There is not a Spinozian scholar on the planet that would stand
by such an interpretation, however. Indeed, most would not entertain a more restricted
dialetheic interpretation either.
5. Hegel
Also of interest, and somewhat later in the history of western philosophy, is the German
philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Hegel is one of those philosophers who are
so obscure that it is difficult to know exactly where he stands on an issue. My view is
that if he is not a trivialist, then he certainly comes very close to being one. Take the
following quote from his analysis of the notion of contradiction in his monumental work
Science of Logic: “Everything is inherently contradictory.”54 This can be taken to mean
that every proposition and its negation are true. Hegel saw contradictions everywhere in
the world including (as he asserts in the same section as the above quote) the
phenomenon of motion. So, at the very least, Hegel can be understood as a dialetheist of
an extreme sort.55
But contradictions are not only at the surface in the phenomenal world. The
contradictory nature of reality goes as deep as you care, according to Hegel. Even the

54 Hegel, The Science of Logic, 439.
55 See Priest & Routley, “An Outline of the History of (Logical) Dialectic,” 85-78.
41
most fundamental of concepts, pure being, is inherently contradictory. Indeed, pure
being is thought by Hegel to be identical to its negation, nothingness:
Being, the indeterminate immediate, is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less
than nothing.
56
Thus Hegel begins his analysis of the world from the most fundamental of concepts to
the most complex through a series of contradictory relations. This is not quite trivialism
but it is, as I have already said, an extreme form of dialetheism.
6. Hua-Yen Buddhism
Also of interest in any history of trivialism are several Eastern philosophies. One such
example is the Chinese Buddhist school of Hua Yen. According to the view expressed by
this school of philosophy, each thing is identical to every other thing:
… the uniqueness of Hua-yen lies in its portrayal of a universe in which the
distinct things that constitute it are fundamentally identical and exist only
through a complex web of interdependency.57

Take, for example, the following verse from the Hua-yen ching (1-240):
The One is the Many.
The Many is the One.
In the word the meaning is to be found.
In the meaning the word is to be understood.
Non-being is Being. Being is Non-being.
Formlessness is Form. Form is Formlessness.
Non-being is Being. Being is Formlessness.58
The claim that everything is identical, (although not explicitly said) implies trivialism, as
it entails that every proposition is identical to every other. As there is at least one true

proposition, it follows that each and every other proposition is true. But it is certainly
not clear that this is the meaning of the teachings of Hua-yen even if it is an implication
of these teachings. In fact it is probably true to say that if one were to confront a
practitioner of Hua-yen with an argument that their view entails trivialism, then they are
likely to point out that you have misunderstood their teachings. I think that an advocate
of Hua-yen is likely to deny that propositions are ‘things’, and therefore the claim
‘everything is identical to everything else’ is not applicable to propositions. Propositions
are not identical to every other thing and so not identical to one another. Alternatively,
the Hua-yen theorist might accuse me of misinterpreting their notion of identity, which is
not to be understood in the manner western logicians are used to interpreting it. As with
the thinkers examined above, there are difficulties in claiming that the Hua-yen
worldview amounts to trivialism even if aspects of this worldview are suggestive of
such an interpretation.
7. Azzouni: a modern advocate
Although there might be real doubts about whether the above thinkers can be
understood as trivialists and the above traditions can amount to trivialism, there is little
doubt about one contemporary thinker – Jody Azzouni. Azzouni’s trivialism was first
expressed in an article entitled “The Strengthened Liar, the Expressive Strength of
Natural Languages, and Regimentation.”59 According to Azzouni, natural language is
trivial, that is to say, every sentence in natural language is true.60 And, of course,

59 The view is also expressed and defended in Tracking Reason, and the article “The Inconsistency
of Natural Languages.”
60 Azzouni, “The Strengthened Liar,” 342.
43
trivialism follows straightforwardly from the triviality of natural language: after all,
‘trivialism is true’ is a sentence in natural language.
But why is natural language trivial? According to Azzouni, it is trivial because it is
inconsistent, and, given that classical logic is the logic of natural language, it follows (by
explosion) that any sentence is true in natural language.61 Azzouni cites two reasons for
thinking that natural language is inconsistent. The first is the existence of the liar
sentence (the self-referential sentence, ‘this sentence is false’) and its various cousins
such as the so-called strengthened liar. Arguably, such sentences entail a contradiction.62
The second reason is of an empirical nature: natural language has developed “…
piecemeal and under no central direction.”63 The development of (non-formal) language
is anarchic, and so one should expect inconsistency and not consistency. I will examine
these reasons for thinking that trivialism is true in chapter 2 of the thesis; suffice to say
for now though, I think that it is straightforwardly fallacious.
Azzouni also undertakes to defend trivialism (or more specifically, the claim that natural
language is trivial) from an important objection:
Many philosophers, perhaps most, believe that if ordinary languages did imply
that every sentence is both true and false, then ordinary languages would be
unusable.64

61 Azzouni, “The Strengthened Liar,” 342-3.
62 Azzouni, “The Strengthened Lair,” 330-40.
63 Priest, In Contradiction, 5; cited in Azzouni, “The Strengthened Liar,” 346.
64 Azzouni, “The Strengthened Liar,” 343. See also Azzouni, “The Inconsistency of Natural
Languages,” 598-604.
44
I am not certain but I suspect that ‘unusable’ in this context means that we would be
unable to distinguish true sentences from false sentences, which is presumably a
propensity that is essential to the use of natural language.65 Alternatively, he might
mean that we cannot at act in a manner that is non-discriminating (as we do when we
buy a loaf of bread or arrange a meeting). Azzouni’s solution is to postulate that users of
natural language practice ‘regimentation’, which amounts to this outcome:
… although natural languages are inconsistent, ordinary speakers do not believe
that they are. In fact, as far as I can tell, almost no one believes that ordinary
languages are inconsistent. And this is hardly surprising since the avoidance of
contradiction is … a norm of ordinary language; and this means that it is rational
for ordinary speakers to believe that ordinary languages are not inconsistent –
despite the presence of evidence (e.g. the liar’s paradoxes) to the contrary.66
There is no reason then for speakers to treat natural language as trivial even if as a
matter of fact it is. The practices of the users of natural language are such that sentences
are kept sufficiently isolated so as to prevent explicit contradiction from taking place.
Because of this, it is possible to practice regimentation:
… if the inferential practices of the users of a language are coherent, then, even if
the implicit principles of that language trivially imply every sentence is true,
users of the language will not act that way. And so, we can capture the coherence
in their practices with natural languages, not by giving truth conditions for the
sentences of those languages, but by supplying a (consistent) regimentation in
that language. That is, we can engineer a (piece of) artificial language, which is
consistent, and capture in the sentences of that language (and the inferential
relations among them) a portion of ordinary language (that we want) with its
sentential vehicles, and the inferential relations empirically established to hold
between those ordinary language vehicles.67
Rather than attempt to work out a priori a formal consistent language that will make the
use of natural language coherent, the trick is to empirically observe how actual language

66 Azzouni, “The Strengthened Liar,” 348. Italics are original.
67 Azzouni, “The Strengthened Liar,” 348-9.
45
users operate and build the regimented language around those observations. The
resulting regimented language is both consistent and has adequate expressive power
(after all, it is based on the actual practices of users). This consistent regimented
language is presumably the way in which users of natural language achieve their
coherent practices.
There has been an important objection made to this line of thinking by Bueno.68 The
objection is this: if Azzouni is right, then ordinary speakers are involved in a major
mistake that is comparable to the one postulated by global skepticism – specifically, that
all their beliefs are in fact false (even if these beliefs are also true). But it would seem,
according to Bueno (following Davidson’s critique of global skepticism), that the notion
of such a systematic and massive error is incoherent, the reason being that it is the
nature of belief that most of these are true.69 Now I do not want to get into a debate
about whether Davidson’s arguments about this are sound, but let us assume that they
are – does this show that the user of a natural language is guilty of the kind of massive
error that Davidson says is not even possible? Well, I for one do not think so. After all, if
natural language is trivial, then all of the beliefs of a natural language user are true. They
are also false as well, but I do not think that this is relevant with respect to Davidson’s
argument. I suspect that the notion of error relevant to Davidson’s argument is this: a
belief is in error if and only if it fails to be true. But the beliefs of the natural language user
do not fail to be true. Rather, they are all true (even if also false). If all the beliefs were

68 Bueno, “Troubles with Trivialism,” 659-61.
69 Bueno, “Troubles with Trivialism,”660-1.
46
false only, then the user of natural language would indeed be in a state of massive error.
But this is not the case.

Bueno also points out that Azzouni fails to deal with the obvious phenomenological
issues raised by trivialism.70 I assume that what Bueno has in mind here is much like the
detailed objection that Graham Priest raises against trivialism: that if trivialism were
true, then we would expect that every observable state of affairs would be contradictory
– but this is not the case.71 Also of concern for me is Azzouni’s argument that natural
language is trivial. This conclusion relies on two premises: that there are inconsistencies
(i.e. true contradictions) in natural language; and that the logic of natural language is
classical. Now this is not likely to convince anyone except the trivialist. It seems to me
that if there are true contradictions in natural language, then the logic of natural
language cannot be classical, as classical logic sets the value of all contradictions to false
by the Law of Non-Contradiction. Of course, until such issues are addressed, Azzouni’s
defense of trivialism is at best incomplete. Now, it is not my intention to respond to
either Azzouni or Bueno in any detail in this section (I will deal with the issue of
phenomenology in chapter 5 and Azzouni’s argument for triviality in section 1 of
chapter 2), but merely to briefly describe the work of a recent trivialist. It is clear,
however, that not everyone shares the intuition that trivialism is outlandish and
ridiculous, or a symptom of insanity.

70 Bueno, “Troubles with Trivialism,” 657.
71 Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions.” I will deal with this objection in chapter 5.
47
As this brief attempt at a history of trivialism shows, other than myself I can be certain
of the existence of only one other trivialist.72 It is the rarest and, given the contemporary
attitude, the most despised of worldviews. I hope in this thesis to convince the reader
that the extreme aversion to trivialism is to be treated with suspicion, and that at the
very least one should consider joining this tiny, but cozy, school of thought. It should be
kept in mind that the writing of a history of trivialism itself adds to the coziness of
trivialism. In other words, a history of this sort has apologetic value. It shows that there
are respected and intelligent people who have advocated or do advocate views that at
the very least either come close to being trivialism or are as much of a violation of
commonsense as trivialism. This, of course, is not evidence that trivialism is true or that
it is coherent or whatnot. But such considerations have a certain psychological force
which is a necessary part of bringing someone to belief in a given claim.

Chapter 2: Deductive Style Arguments for Trivialism
1. Introductory Comments
Are there any reasons for thinking that trivialism is true? I think that indeed there are,
and such reasons would appear to be in plentiful supply. In this chapter I will comment
briefly on five such arguments: the explosive liar; the Curry Paradox; the argument from
the Characterization Principle; an argument from possibilism; and an argument from a
trivial entity. I will argue that all but the first of these are sound. In fact I am willing to
push the view that these arguments are as good as anything that you will find in
philosophy. Every argument for any interesting position in philosophy will be based on
premises and inferences that can be rejected without violating one’s epistemic
obligations. In that sense then one could always resist these arguments for trivialism by
declining to accept central premises in the arguments. But having said that, the premises
are not ridiculous in any straightforward manner (other than the fact that they entail
trivialism), and indeed they are accepted by at least some contemporary philosophers in
other dialectical contexts. One should not hold trivialism to a higher standard of proof
than one is willing to hold other philosophical positions.
One final warning before I begin my analysis. I am not going to provide a thorough
defense of every premise or every inference in every argument. To do so would quickly
turn this from a thesis about trivialism to a thesis about the Principle of Sufficient
Reason, or noneism, or possibilism, for example. Often I will merely summarize the
work done by others in this regard as I do not make use of any premises or inferences
that have not been defended by others elsewhere. The reader should expect to see an
49
outline of the argument with a succinct summary of the issues at stake in the argument,
together with a summary of the attempts at a defense of the premises and inferences in
question.
2. The Explosive Liar
Take the following argument for trivialism73:
(1) L is true
(2) It is not the case that L is true
(3) Therefore, trivialism is true.
Here L is simply the self-referential liar sentence: ‘L is false’. Note that one could
substitute for L any so called dialetheia (i.e. sentence that is both true and false). The
most obvious alternative is the Russell paradox generated by the naïve conception of set
(i.e. the set of all sets that fail to have self-membership). One then could have as premise
(1), ‘R is a member of itself’, and for (2), ‘It is not the case that R is a member of itself’. I
will not examine R as an alternative to L, as much of what I have to say about the latter
applies to the former. The inference from (1) and (2) to (3) is traditionally known as ex
contradictione quodlibet, and it takes the general form of p, ¬p├ q. More recently it has
come to be referred to as explosion.74 Note that the argument can be modified to prove

73 This is essentially the argument for the triviality of natural language proposed in Azzouni,
“The Strengthened Liar.” Azzouni (drawing on Priest, In Contradiction, 5) also proposes empirical
reasons for claiming that natural language is inconsistent. According to Azzouni, we should
expect natural language to be inconsistent given that it has developed in a piecemeal and
anarchic fashion. Only an ordered and coordinated development could guarantee consistency -
see Azzouni, “The Strengthened Liar,” 346.
74 It is interesting to note the kind of language used to describe triviality – words such as
‘explosion’ and ‘collapse’ are frequent. I have even heard Graham Priest use the Japanese word
for goodbye, ‘sayonara’, to describe premises that entail everything. Presumably such terms are
meant to convey the idea that trivialism amounts to logical chaos or breakdown. But this hardly
50
the truth of any arbitrary proposition, p. If sound, this argument would provide
independent evidence for every belief held by the trivialist.
Is this argument sound? Well there are reasons to think that the premises are true and
that inference is valid. Let’s begin with the truth of the premises. The liar sentence in
some form or another has been known for some time. It was supposedly discovered or
first uttered by the Megaric philosopher Eubilides. Normally taken as a paradox that
requires solution, it has more recently been argued that it is an instance of a dialetheia
i.e. a true contradiction.75 The argument for thinking that L is both true and false goes as
follows. Either L is true or L is false (by the Law of Excluded Middle or LEM). If it is
true, then what it says is the case and it says that it is false, so it is false. If it is false, then
this is what it says it is, so it is true. Either way it is both true and false.
This argument is prima facie sound, but there has been no shortage of attempts to point
out where it fails. There are essentially two approaches to making a critique of the so
called liar paradox.76 One attempt is to show that L itself is senseless or meaningless
because of its self-referential nature. The assumption behind such a reply is that the
English language has a structure that resembles some sort of hierarchy. This hierarchy is
structured such that at any one level the predicate, ‘is true’ is made only of things in the
levels below and never at the same level. Now this is a straightforwardly empirical claim

amounts to a coherent denial of trivialism given the arguments I propose in chapter 3. But the
point here is that opponents of trivialism have much to offer in the way of emotive language, but
little to offer in the way of reasonable argument.
75 The most sustained effort in recent times is to be found in Priest, In Contradiction. See also his
Doubt Truth to be a Liar.
76 Much of what I say here is drawn from Priest, In Contradiction, 10-27.
51
being made about the nature of the English language (and indeed any natural language).
The question is whether this empirical claim is at all true or if there is any reason for
thinking that it is true. It would seem that there is no reason for thinking that it is true
and, indeed, there seems to be reason for thinking that it is false. To show that it is false,
Priest, on page 19 of his study of dialetheism states that “All sentences on page 19 of the
second edition of In Contradiction are true.”77 Priest notes that the sentence is perfectly
good English and that given that there is at least one false sentence on the page it has a
truth-value that is determinate (i.e. false). As such it cannot be part of any supposed
hierarchy of English as it assigns a truth-value to itself – something forbidden by the
hierarchy account of natural language. But, on the contrary, this sentence would appear
to be straightforward English. So it is clear that English (or any natural language) cannot
be characterized by such a hierarchy. This is not to say, of course, that one cannot
formulate a language that is characterized by such a hierarchy and so avoid paradoxes
such as the liar sentence in such a language. But such a language will not be English (or
any natural language). Such a language will be weaker in its expressive power than
natural language, as it will not be able to express sentences such as the above one from
page 19 of In Contradiction that are not in any sense paradoxical, let alone sentences that
are paradoxical (such as the liar sentence).
An alternative approach is to deny a crucial assumption of the argument, specifically to
deny that the LEM is true. As such one is unable to validly reason that ‘L is true iff L is
false, therefore, L is both true and false’. This is because L might very well be neither

77 Priest 2006, 19.
52
true nor false. Now there are two ways in which one can respond to the claim that the
LEM is false. The first is to provide argument in support of the truth of the LEM. One
such argument is from Priest.78 Those who deny the LEM do so because it is thought that
there are sentences that are neither true nor false (L is often thought to be amongst them)
– so called truth-value gaps. The reason usually given is that there is no fact about the
world that makes such a sentence, α, true, nor is there any fact in the world that makes
it’s negation, ¬α, true. As such α is neither true nor false. But, as Priest points out, such
reasoning fails to work, because
… if there is no Fact that makes α true, there is a Fact that makes ¬α true, viz, the
Fact that there is no Fact that makes α true. Less cryptically, the point is this.
Suppose that α is a sentence. And suppose that there is nothing in the world in
virtue of which α is true – no fact, no proof, no experimental test. Then this is the
Fact in virtue of which ¬α is true.79
A sentence simply cannot fail to have a truth-value, because the very failure to be made
true is sufficient to provide it with a truth-value, namely a truth-value of false.
But even if it were the case that LEM is false and there were truth-value gaps (with L
being amongst these), this will only shift the paradox of the liar to another level.80 That is
to say that we can reformulate the liar paradox in such a way that even with the falsity
of the LEM there are sentences that are both true and false (and so can be used for our
premises (1) and (2)). One such sentence is (M), which states: (M) is not true. What is the
truth-value of (M)? If we allow for truth-value gaps, then it will either be true, false, or
valueless. If it is true, then what it says is the case, which is that it is not true. If it is false

78 Priest 2006, 64-6.
79 Priest 2006, 65-6.
80 Priest 2006, 12-6.
53
or valueless (i.e. not true), then that is what it says it is, and so is true. Hence, no matter
what the truth-value of the sentence, a contradiction will follow.
Of course, much more could be said about all these points. Replies and counter-replies
can and have been made. But what this very brief summary shows is that a case can be
made for the truth of premises (1) and (2), and so the truth of dialetheism in general.81
It turns out though that whether or not (1) and (2), and dialetheism in general, are true is
irrelevant to the purposes at hand. The reason for this is that if premises (1) and (2) are
true, then inference from (1) and (2) to (3) is invalid. The validity of the inference of
explosion standardly relies on the fact that one of the premises will fail to be true in
every evaluation i.e. it assumes the truth of the law of Non-Contradiction. That is to say,
explosion is vacuously valid: the reason why there is no evaluation in which both
premises are true and the conclusion false is because there is no evaluation in which
both premises are true. As soon as we allow L to be both true and false, there are
evaluations in which both of the premises are true and yet the conclusion is false. In
other words, the inference is not truth preserving when we reject the LNC. We must
choose between either true premises or a valid inference – but we cannot have both.
Either way, the argument is unsound.

81 Indeed, a leading opponent of dialetheism admits that it is very difficult to refute the truth of
dialetheism given the liar paradox – see Sainsbury, R.M. Paradoxes, 2nd ed., (Cambridge
University Press, 1995), ix.
54
3. The Curry Paradox
Recently it has become an industry to take some of the most intractable paradoxes and
reinterpret them as sound arguments to controversial conclusions. The most well known
example of this is the liar paradox, which is reinterpreted as a sound argument for
dialetheism. Another is the Curry Paradox82, which I interpret here as a sound argument
for trivialism. Take the following sentence, δ: If δ is true, then trivialism.
(1) If δ is true , then if δ is true, then trivialism [by T-schema]
(2) If δ is true, then trivialism [(1) by contraction]
(3) δ is true [(2) by T-schema]
(4) trivialism [(2), (4) by modus ponens]
This is prima facie a sound argument for trivialism – the view that every sentence is true.
Indeed, one can modify the argument to prove the truth of any proposition, p, by
applying it to the sentence, δ: If δ is true, then p. This would provide the trivialist with
independent evidence for each and every one of her beliefs.
Traditionally, this argument has been rejected as unsound, and this has been for the
reason that its conclusion (that trivialism is true) is obviously false or absurd. But there
has never been general agreement on where the argument fails to be sound.83 One
suggestion is that δ fails to express a proposition or it expresses a proposition that is
other than the self-referential one expressed above. Another suggestion is that the Tschema fails in this regard (perhaps because it cannot be used self-referentially). These

82 First articulated in Curry, “The Inconsistency of Certain Formal Systems,” 115-7 (although
Curry does not defend the soundness of the paradox).
83 Restall, On Logics without Contraction, vii.
55
are the kinds of solutions applied to the liar paradox discussed in the previous section.
In addition, it has also been suggested that the inference of contraction (here used from
(1) to (2)) is invalid. Making sense of a rejection of this inference is a costly affair in
some ways and requires one to have to redevelop logic in a way that does not require
such an inference – and this is not such an easy task.84 Certainly contraction is valid
given the material account of the conditional, but few logicians would believe that this
account is the final word on conditionality. For instance, the inference fails for some
relevant accounts of the conditional which make use of impossible worlds.85
But when this paradox is being interpreted as an argument for trivialism, then it is
outright question-begging to claim that it fails to be sound because it results in
trivialism. One can no longer reject the T-schema or claim that δ does not express a
proposition or reject the validity of contraction merely because they give rise to this
paradox. There needs to be independent reason for making one of these moves. But it is
difficult to see what these independent reasons could be. This, of course, is not to say
that there might not be useful applications for contraction-free logics, for example. It is
just that the motive for such logics cannot be because of the failure of trivialism, at least
in the dialectical context of a debate with a trivialist.86

84 Although there has been much success in achieving this end - see, for example, Restall, On
Logics without Contraction. More recently there has been an attempt by Brady, Universal Logic. The
advantage of Brady’s logic DJd
 (at least according to him) is that it is a non-ad hoc solution to the
Curry Paradox. The logic is motivated by independent reasons based on the meaning of
entailment and negation. See also Brady, “Entailment, Negation and Paradox Solution,” 113-35.
85 See Priest, “Paraconsistent Logic,”sect. 8.
86 Restall, On Logics without Contraition, provides an account of some of these applications.
56
I conclude, tentatively at least, that the Curry Paradox might very well be a sound
argument for the conclusion that trivialism is true. Its dialectic power resides in the fact
that very little indeed has to be assumed in order for it to be convincing. All that is
required is the T-schema, the inference of contraction, and modus ponens. Of course one
could always reject one or all of these in order to avoid the conclusion that trivialism is
true. But other than the fact that these give rise to a trivial conclusion, philosophers
would not normally think that there was anything wrong with these. My own view is
that this argument is as convincing as an argument for any philosophically interesting
position, and so should be taken seriously. Trivialism should not be treated as a special
case in this regard. Philosophers have committed to claims on the basis of a lot less.
4. The Argument from the Characterization Principle
The Characterization Principle (CP) is simply the principle that “an object characterized
as an, or the, object satisfying certain properties does indeed have those properties.”87
An argument for trivialism can be constructed by making explicit use of the CP as
follows: Take the property of being true and being the proposition ‘every proposition is
true’. Now take the object characterized as both being true and being the proposition
‘every proposition is true’. Clearly, given the CP, trivialism is true. The argument can be
developed in other ways that enable the trivialist to provide independent reason for
each and every belief she has. As well showing that the proposition ‘every proposition is
true’ is true using the CP, she can apply the CP to each and every distinct proposition.
So, she can take the object characterized as being some arbitrary proposition p and

87 Priest, Beyond the Limits of Thought, 59.
57
characterized as being true. It follows that p is true. On this variation, we have in
addition to the proposition ‘every proposition is true’, each and every proposition being
true. Moreover, the trivialist can use the CP to not only prove the truth of each and
every proposition, but also to prove the existence of any arbitrary object. For any
arbitrary object o she can prove that o exists in the following way: o is characterized as
the object with the set of properties {x,y,z,…} and as existing. Given the CP, o has those
properties and exists. For example, let a dragon be the object characterized as being
reptilian, with the power to breathe fire, and existing. By the CP we can conclude that
the creature so characterized exists.
But is the CP true? Well, traditionally the CP has been rejected because it leads to
triviality. But in this context such an objection is clearly question-begging. What is
required is a reason for rejecting the CP that is independent of the rejection of trivialism.
But it is not clear what this could be. The CP seems to me to be intuitively true. It
certainly explains how we can represent to ourselves a given object, whether it exists or
not:
Thus, we represent Holmes as living in Baker Street, being a detective of acute
powers of observation and inference etc.; we … represent Vulcan … as being a
planet that has a sub-Mercurial orbit, and whose existence accounts for the
precession of Mercury’s orbit; and so on.88
The power of the CP in explaining our ability to represent objects to ourselves is
therefore well and truly something in its favor.

88 Priest, Towards Non-Being, 83.
58
But it has been suggested that those who think that the CP is true are actually in some
sort of cognitive confusion. Priest, for example, suggests that those who think that the
CP is intuitive are confusing it with another logical principle, namely the principle: ∀x
(Px→Px), i.e. everything is what it is.89 Obviously this latter principle is true, but it
certainly does not necessarily refer to an object, as the CP does. Of course, the suggestion
that someone who finds the CP intuitive is really logically confused is insulting. I am not
stupid – I know what I find to be intuitive, and it is the CP that I find to be intuitive.
Enough said on this point then.90
However, in a later publication, Priest puts forward a different account or interpretation
of the CP that he argues has all the logical advantages of the original version, and yet it
avoids triviality.91 Priest accepts the full generality of the CP but interprets it in terms of
world semantics:
Qua object of thought, I said, an object characterized in a certain way has all the
properties deployed in its characterization. This suggests an answer: Let A(x) be
any condition: this characterizes an object , cA. And cA is true – maybe not at this
world, but at other worlds.92
This, at least on the face of it, would solve the problems that supposedly plague the CP
and yet keep all the benefits it engenders in the form of a plausible account of how we
characterize objects. All characterizations are satisfied, but not necessarily satisfied in the
actual world. For example, there is an object characterized as having the name of
Sherlock Holmes and living on Baker Street etc., but this object clearly exists in worlds

89 Priest, Beyond the Limits of Thought, 59.
90 Although it is fair to say that before the advent of modern logic it was much easier to confuse
the CP with this other principle. The use of a formal language has provided much clarity.
91 Priest, Towards Non-Being, 82-5.
92 Priest, Towards Non-Being, 84.
59
(there will be more than one given that the description is incomplete) other than the
actual world.
There are two responses I wish to make to Priest’s proposal. First, it is clear that his
rejection of the CP in its original and pure form is question-begging in the current
context. Rejecting the original CP because it leads to triviality is hardly an acceptable
position in a debate with a trivialist. Secondly, although it is true that Priest’s reading of
the CP enables him to account for the fact that we can represent to ourselves a given
object, it is not clear that it can do this as effectively as the CP as it was originally
understood. It is clear that the original CP is a far simpler principle than the version
favored by Priest, in as much as it does not require a conceptual apparatus of possible
and impossible worlds (with the attendant and complex problems of interpreting what
exactly a world is) in order to do the job of explaining how we represent objects to
ourselves. Other things being equal, we should favor the simpler principle. After all, it is
better able to explain why we feel it to be intuitive. Few people have intuitions about the
ontological status of possible worlds, for example, and yet will find the CP intuitive
nevertheless.
There are other objections to the CP. The most important is probably this: The CP
presupposes noneism. Noneism or meinogianism is the view that some objects do not
exist.93 It is clear that the CP presupposes noneism. The question is whether this should

93 There are various versions of this view. Meinong held that there were alongside existent objects
and non-existent objects a third category: objects that subsist: a category that includes abstract
concepts and numbers. Routley held that there are only existent (concrete and temporally
60
count against the argument. That is to say, is there anything wrong with noneism? If
noneism is false, then certainly the argument does fail. As such, this argument for
trivialism will in no way persuade anyone who is resolute in their rejection of this
ontology (or nontology?).
Whether noneism is true I cannot hope to settle in this chapter. However, what is
certainly true is that noneism is not as implausible as has been made out by its
opponents. Indeed, historically it is more prevalent than one would have suspected
given the rhetoric of those who deny it.94 Most of the objections to it are quite weak, with
some of them being quite clearly question begging or straw-man arguments.95 One
objection is that the noneist has no intelligible way to express his view. The noneist is
required to quantify over nonexistent objects. But this makes no sense, as quantification,
as it is understood in the tradition represented by Frege, Russell, and Quine, is
existentially loaded. Now noneists have responded to this by introducing a new
quantifier into their logic, in addition to the old quantifiers. Alongside ∃ and ∀ (known

present) and nonexistent objects (everything else including abstract concepts and numbers), and
nothing else. Priest agrees, but includes in existent objects concrete objects of the past and future.
Presumably Priest advocates some form of the B-theory of time whilst Routley advocates a form
of presentism. For a different interpretation of Meinong see Perszyk, Nonexistent Objects. Perszyk
argues that Meinong held that non-existent objects are sets of properties and not concrete
individuals. This position certainly differs from the noneism of Priest, who claims that some
objects are impossible worlds (which are themselves nonexistent objects) in which even abstract
entities such as sets and numbers may be concrete individuals (e.g. some object is an impossible
world and in that world I am the number 3). See Priest, Towards Non-Being, 135-7.
94 See Priest, Towards Non-Being, for more.
95 A good example is Russell’s attempt at a refutation of Meinong’s position. What Russell
actually refutes is his own previously held position i.e. the claim that various impossible objects
have some sort of logical being. But Meinong’s position is that such objects have no being of any
sort – they are nonexistent. See Priest, Towards Non-Being, 106-8. Meinong did, however, accept
that abstract concepts such as numbers have subsistence – and so Russell’s critique of this aspect
of Meinong’s theory is not a straw-man.
61
as inner quantifiers which are existentially loaded), there is, say, S and A (known as
outer quantifiers which involve no commitment to the existence of the objects they
quantify over). To say ∃x(x does not exist) would be incoherent – one is literally
speaking in a self-contradictory manner. But what the noneist says is not that, but rather
Sx(x does not exist). That is to say, some object does not exist.
There are other objections or difficulties that have been raised against noneism, but I do
not believe that these are as serious as the claim that it is incoherent or unintelligible. For
example, some have wondered how noneism differs from Platonism. Others have asked
how we could know about and refer to nonexistent objects (such as numbers and
fictional characters), or how nonexistent abstract objects (such as numbers) could be
used to model the physical world. A related objection raises the difficulty of how our
knowledge of mathematical objects and fictional objects differ given that these objects
are both nonexistent – is there really anything special about mathematical objects that
makes them unique among nonexistent things? Then there are the usual objections
against being able to reason with inconsistent objects, which occur in fiction (and
arguably mathematics). I will not rehearse the various solutions to these difficulties here
as this has been done elsewhere by others.96
Of course, not everyone agrees. Terry Horgan writes in response to Priest’s defense of
noneism:

96 The best known defenses are Priest, Towards Non-Being, especially Part II; and Routley,
Exploring Meinong’s Jungle.
62
By and large, I find Priest’s replies to such objections quite persuasive, given the
assumption that noneism is an intelligible position. But, like others who have
written skeptically about noneism, I am very dubious about the intelligibility
assumption. I find myself unable to shake the conviction that noneism – despite
its surface air of intelligibility – is profoundly unintelligible. Priest’s discussion
does little to dispel my worries on this score, and I suspect that many other
readers will react similarly.97
I find it unlikely that such a view can be changed, given that it is based on intuitions
very different from those of the noneist. Presumably, Horgan thinks that the
introduction of a new set of quantifiers into the language does nothing to solve the
problem. I assume that he sees such quantifiers as S and A to be empty nonsense.98 In
addition, Horgan thinks that many of the problems that noneism is supposed to be able
to solve (like explaining intentionality) can be solved with alternative methods. Clearly,
the argument for trivialism defended in this section will be unconvincing to some. But I
am content to rest my case with those who advocate noneism in some form or another.
So this argument will only have dialectical success with those who accept the relevant
premises.
But, as with the Curry Paradox above, philosophers have accepted various philosophical
theses on a lot less than this. I implore the reader not to treat trivialism any differently in
this regard. If you would have accepted the relevant premises before finding out that
they lead to trivialism, then this latter implication should not in any way change this,
and as such you should commit to believing the claim that trivialism is true.

98 This is also the view of Lewis, “Noneism or Allism?”
63
5. The Argument from Possibilism
The next argument for trivialism I wish to spell out can perhaps be dubbed a modal
argument for trivialism and can be expressed as follows:
(1) Possibilism is true [prem.]
(2) If possibilism is true, then there is a world (either possible or impossible or
both)99, w, in which trivialism is true [prem.]
(3) w is a possible world [prem.]
(4) It is true in w that w is identical to the actual world, A [(2)]
(5) If it is true that there is a world, w, and w is a possible world, and it is true in w
that w is identical to A, then trivialism is true [prem.]
(6) Trivialism is true [(1)-(5)].
Is premise 1 true? Possibilism is the view that every proposition is possible and is to be
contrasted with the view known as necessitarianism: the view that there is at least one
impossible proposition. Possibilism has been seriously advocated by a number of
philosophers in the last forty years or so.100 The doctrine is said to have a number of
advantages over its rival, necessitarianism. There seems a genuine sense in which socalled necessary truths could have been false. Mortenson, for example, points out that if
we make use of a model-theoretic account of necessity (i.e. truth in all models, whether
these be understood as possible worlds or what not), it is easy enough to show that one

99 By ‘possible world’ I mean a world which shares the same laws of logic as the actual world. By
‘impossible world’ I mean a world in which the laws of logic are different from the actual world.
For example, the law of identity may fail to hold in an impossible world, but it will hold (by
definition) in a possible world.
100 The term was first coined and defended in Naess, Pluralist and Possibilist. It has been more
recently defended in Mortenson, “Anything is Possible,” and Mortenson, “It isn’t so, But Could it
Be?” The doctrine has also been proposed to solve certain problems concerning divine nature –
see, for example, Plantinga, Does God have a Nature?
64
can construct models in which anything fails to be true – so called impossible worlds, for
example, if you understand models in terms of world semantics.101 In order for
necessitarianism to hold true, one would need independent reason for restricting the
relevant models.102 But such reasons, according to Mortenson, are usually not
forthcoming.
In addition, it has been claimed that possibilism has a range of epistemological
advantages over necessitarianism. Mortenson sums this position up nicely in the
following quote:
… possibilism has the virtue of the generality and economy of epistemic monism.
This term … refers to a wholly general method for establishing truths, namely
the scientific method of empirical theory-choice using experiment and
observation. There is no need to cater for the knowledge-base of an entirely
distinctive set of necessary truths. The problem here is not that necessary truths
could not be shown to be true by ordinary scientific means, for they obviously
can. The problem is how one would come to know that they are necessary …103
According to Mortenson, there is economy of epistemology in committing oneself to
possibilism. Given that scientific methods can not establish the necessity of a truth
(perhaps because postulating such necessity adds nothing to the explanatory power of
the truth), one would require something in addition to scientific method to establish this.
One’s epistemology would thus lack the benefit of simplicity.
Premise 2 certainly seems to be true. If there are no necessary propositions, then the law
of nontriviality, i.e. that some propositions fail to be true, is not necessary. As such, its

101 Mortenson, “It isn’t so, But Could it Be?,” 354. See also Mortenson, “Anything is Possible,”
328-33.
102 Mortenson, “It isn’t so, But Could it Be?,” 354.
103 Mortenson, “It isn’t so, But Could it Be?,” 353.
65
negation is possible, i.e. that all propositions are true. And if it is possible, then there is
some world in which it is true.104 Now one might be tempted to respond to this premise
in the following way: “Surely the truth of possibilism does not entail that there is a
world in which all propositions are true. Rather, all it entails is that every proposition is
true in some world, i.e. all propositions are true distributively and not collectively.”105 I
think though that this objection is rather weak and misses the mark. A possibilism that
rules out a trivial world is really a watered down (‘Clayton’s’ if you will) version of
possibilism. After all, such a version of possibilism still allows for one necessary
proposition, namely the Law of Non-Triviality. The objection then assumes that there is
no world in which every proposition is true – that is to say it is a necessary truth that not
every proposition is true. But the support that full-blown possibilism receives from the
arguments discussed above would not accrue to this watered-down version. Indeed, this
alternative seems rather arbitrary – why is it that just this one proposition (the Law of
Non-Triviality) is necessarily true and not some other proposition? Any answer to this
question would seem rather contrived.
What of premise 3? It is certainly true, as everything is true in w given its triviality. It
follows then that the laws of logic (in particular the law of identity) are true in w. Of
course, w is also an impossible world, as the laws of logic also fail to be true there. The
world w is therefore both a possible world and an impossible world. In particular then it
is a possible world. Now one might raise an objection here that can be expressed

104 Mortenson, “It isn’t so, But Could it Be?,” 355. See also Mortenson, “Anything is Possible,”331-
3.
105 This distinction is discussed in Mortenson, “It isn’t so But Could it Be?,” 355.
66
something like this: “Surely all that follows from the fact that trivialism is true in w is
that it is true in w that w is a possible world, not that it is true simpliciter that w is a
possible world.” Well, I do not think so. What makes w a possible world is simply that
the laws of logic are true there. The only way that the ‘laws of logic’ could be true in w
and yet it not be the case that it is true simpliciter that w is a possible world, is if we
equivocate on what is meant by the term ‘laws of logic’. Everything is true in w, and that
means that those things that we call the laws of logic are true in w – and so w is a
possible world, by definition.
Proposition (4) is also true for the same reason – if w is trivial, then everything is true in
w and so it is true in w that it is identical to the actual world.
The crucial work is done in premise (5). The law of identity is shared across possible
worlds, including (by definition) the actual world. If two things are identical in some
possible world that is not the actual world, then they are identical in the actual world
itself. To deny this is to think that an object cannot be identical to itself, which is
impossible (and so only true in an impossible world). Given then that w is a possible
world and the actual world is identical to it in w, it follows that it is true in the actual
world, A, that w is identical to A. That is to say, the actual world is trivial or,
equivalently, trivialism is true.
Note that this argument does not assume any obscure inferential rules such as explosion
or contraction. All it assumes is that possibilism is true. Now I think that this argument
is sound – but not everyone would be keen on such a conclusion. Very few philosophers
67
espouse possibilism, and given that it leads to trivialism, the number of those
advocating it is likely to get smaller. The reasons for possibilism are hardly conclusive.
Take the above argument for possibilism from epistemic monism. Some at least are
unlikely to see why epistemic monism should at all be considered a virtue. Indeed, if
there are necessary propositions, then following epistemic monism would be disastrous,
as one would never be able to work this out. Moreover, not everyone will see why
scientific method (whatever this is) should be considered as having primacy in all
circumstances. Indeed, Mortenson himself has the good sense to see that possibilism is
deeply unintuitive and that this counts against it.106
But having said all that, it is clear that those who accept possibilism should accept
trivialism given this argument. But even those who reject possibilism need to give
reasons why they find the arguments for this position unpersuasive. Moreover, the
admission that possibilism is unintuitive should not be given too much weight. Much
that is unintuitive is given serious and widespread credence in philosophical circles
because of the strength of argument. A case in point is the so-called B-theory of time.
Nothing could be more unintuitive in a theory of time than the claim that the present
has no privileged ontological status over and above the past and future. And yet many
philosophers by-pass this unintuitiveness purely on the basis of philosophical argument.
Once again, trivialism should be treated just like any philosophical theory and judged

106 Mortenson, “It isn’t so, But Could it Be?,” 354. See also Mortenson, “Anything is Possible,”
333-4.
68
according to the same criteria. That it is most odd and unpopular is neither here nor
there.
6. A Cosmological Argument for a Trivial Entity
Let us define a trivial entity as an entity that instantiates every predicate, i.e. an entity of
which everything is true. One of the things true of a trivial entity is that it exists in a
reality in which trivialism is true. Hence, if a trivial entity exists, then trivialism is true.
But is it true that there exists a trivial entity? Here is an argument for thinking that it is
true:
1) Every being (or entity or object) is either trivial or nontrivial
2) It is not the case that every being is nontrivial
3) Hence, there exists a trivial being107
By a nontrivial being I mean a being which instantiates some but not all predicates.
Premise 1) exhausts the logical possibilities. But why think that premise 2) is true?
The reason why premise 2) is true follows directly from the truth of the PSR (the
Principle of Sufficient Reason). According to the PSR “… nothing is, without sufficient
reason why it is, rather than not; and why it is thus, rather than otherwise.”108 Or, to put
it another way “… no fact can be true or existing and no statement truthful without a
sufficient reason for its being so and not different …”109 Alternatively, it has been
articulated as “Everything that is the case must have a reason why it is the case.

107 This argument is inspired by Samuel Clark’s Cosmological Argument for an independent
being – see Rowe, The Cosmological Argument.
108 Clarke & Leibniz, The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, 30.
109 Leibniz, Monadology and Other Philosophical Essays, 153.
69
Necessarily, every true proposition or at least every contingent true proposition has an
explanation.”110 Now, if every object were nontrivial, then there would be a fact that
would be unexplained, specifically the fact of nontriviality. That is to say, the
nontriviality of nontrivial beings would be inexplicable. What I mean here is that one
would need to explain why only some predicates are instantiated and not all predicates
are instantiated. One could not cite the existence of another nontrivial being as the
explanation for the nontriviality of other nontrivial beings, as this would be viciously
circular. Likewise, one could not explain the nontriviality of a given being, B1, by citing
the existence of another nontrivial being, B2, whose nontriviality is in turn explained by
the existence of another nontrivial being, B3, and so on in an infinite series of nontrivial
beings. Now either the infinite series (of nontrivial entities) as a whole is trivial or it is
nontrivial. If it is trivial, then there exists a trivial entity. If it is nontrivial, then the
nontriviality of the series as a whole has not been explained. But this cannot be so
because nontriviality requires an explanation given the truth of the PSR. It follows then
that the series as a whole is trivial. Therefore, there exists a trivial entity (the series as a
whole) and trivialism is true.
Of course, the only thing that will explain all this nontriviality is a trivial being. Any
explanatory regress will cease in a satisfactory manner at the postulating of a trivial
being. Such a being is not one way as opposed to another, that is to say there is no need
to explain why only some predicates are true of it as opposed to others – all predicates
are true of it. So, for example, it is not trivial as opposed to nontrivial, as its triviality also

110 Pruss, The Principle of Sufficient Reason, 3.
70
entails its nontriviality. Moreover, its existence really does explain the existence of
nontrivial beings. After all, one of the predicates true of a trivial being is that it exists in a
world in which there are nontrivial beings.
Clearly the argument assumes the truth of the PSR. Given how crucial this principle is
for the argument, and given how unpopular it is these days, it would be appropriate to
say a few words in its defense. Much of what follows in this section is merely a
summary of the work of others. Moreover, it is not supposed to be more than a
summary. All I wish to indicate is that a commitment to the PSR is not an irrational act,
despite the unpopularity of the principle among contemporary philosophers. My main
aim in this section is to demonstrate that a commitment to the unrestricted application of
the PSR will lead to trivialism, and that such an unrestricted application is not an
implausible move to make.
There have been various arguments raised against the PSR. It has been pointed out, for
example, that it is incompatible with modern physics, in particular that it is
incompatible with what our most successful physical theory (quantum mechanics) tells
us about the nature of atomic scale events. The use of quantum theory in the argument
against PSR is a popular move and dates back to mid-last century. Russell for example,
cited it in his famous debate on the existence of God with Copleston.111 The claim here is
that many such events are indeterministic by nature and so have no causes, and
therefore, no sufficient reason for why they occur.

111 Russell & Copleston, “The Existence of God.”
71
It has also been pointed out that the principle is incompatible with the nature of human
choice and action. The claim here is that human choice is characterized by a libertarian
variety of freedom (an agent acts freely with respect to some choice if, and only if, it was
within in the agents power to have done otherwise). On this account of freedom, a
human act is ultimately uncaused if it is free. A good recent example of this response is
the philosopher William Lane Craig who is a supporter of the libertarian account of
freewill. Craig argues that
[t]hese latter-day Leibnizians want everything to be brought under the control of
the Principle of Sufficient Reason, including facts concerning human free choices
… What libertarians are committed to is the brute ultimacy of free choices and so
to their final inexplicity.112
It has also been argued that the principle is ultimately incompatible with the nature of
contingency i.e. it is claimed that if the PSR is true, then everything is necessary. Indeed,
this has also been a point conceded by some supporters of the PSR including, most
famously, Spinoza (for example, Ethics, IP29; IIP35S).
Plausible replies have been made to all of these objections. For example, in response to
the claim that quantum mechanics rules out the truth of the PSR it has been argued that
there are deterministic interpretations of this physical theory that are empirically
equivalent to the indeterministic interpretations. Two examples of such a deterministic
interpretation come to mind. The first is David Bohm’s version that seeks to specify the
hidden variables that determine why one event (say the decay of a radium atom at a

112 Craig, “Ducking Friendly Fire,” 165-6.
72
given point in time) occurs rather than it not occurring.113 The second is the so-called
Many Worlds Interpretation, which implies that both such events occur rather than one
occurring as opposed to the other, albeit they occur in different ‘universes’ or ‘worlds’.114
More interestingly, it has been suggested that even the indeterministic versions satisfy
the PSR – indeterministic events have a cause, namely an indeterministic cause.115
As regards the claim that the libertarian account of freewill rules out the PSR, one could
quite plausibly reply that humans do not have freewill or at least they do not have
freewill of the libertarian variety. Indeed, the very notion of a distinct mental faculty
corresponding to the will seems incoherent to many.116 My own preference is for a
version of compatabalism. But it has even been suggested that libertarian freedom is
quite compatible with the PSR.117 An early example of this seems to have been Samuel
Clarke in his famous correspondence with Leibniz.118 The idea here is that the sufficient
reason for why a choice has been made is that it was freely chosen by an agent.

113 Bohm, “A Suggested Interpretation,” 180-93.
114 A clearly written analysis of the Many-Worlds Interpretation can be found in Lewis, “How
Many Lives Has Schrodinger’s Cat?” 3-22.
115 Pruss, The Principle of Sufficient Reason, 168-70. Also, there is a version of quantum theory that
sees the explanation for why the atomic world is probabilistic in the fact that it is made up of
individual entities that are intrinsically probabilistic. See Maxwell, The Comprehensibility of the
Universe, Ch. 7. Maxwell refers to such a probabilistic entity as a propensiton – a propensiton
being an entity that has as its essential properties propensities (a term and concept borrowed
from Popper, “The Propensity Interpretation.”). Quentin Smith also seems to favor interpreting
the PSR in a manner that encompasses probabilistic quantum causes – see Smith, “The Wave
Function of a Godless Universe,” 326-37. Other supporters of indeterministic accounts of
quantum mechanics, however, would resist the idea that the PSR can be interpreted so as to be
compatible with such accounts – see for example Grünbaum, “The Poverty of Theistic
Cosmology, 574-5; and Priest, Beyond the Limits of Thought, 38.
116 For an analysis of this claim I find it difficult to go past Ryle, The Concept of Mind, chapter III.
117 Pruss 2006, chapter 7.
118 Clarke & Leibniz, The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, 20-1.
73
Finally, in reply to the claim that the PSR is incompatible with contingency one could
just take the view of Spinoza and deny that there is any real contingency in the world.
Others have taken a different strategy to this objection, namely showing that they are
compatible: the fact that supposedly has no explanation (specifically, the conjunction of
all contingent facts) can surely be explained by the truth of each of the conjuncts
together with the fact that the truth value of conjunction is determined solely by the
truth values of the conjuncts.119 Such an explanation seems straightforwardly compatible
with contingency.
In addition, there are positive reasons in favor of the truth of the PSR.120 Perhaps the
most common approach has been to claim that the PSR is self-evident (I suspect Clarke
and the seventeenth century rationalists thought as much). Moreover, it need not be selfevident to everyone for this to be a sensible position. For someone who finds the
principle to be self-evident, attempts to justify it in any absolute sense might be
impossible as there might not be any premises available that are more certain than the
PSR. This, of course, does not prevent an advocate of the principle from putting forward
an argument for the PSR based on premises that the opponent would accept as being
more certain. Ad hominum arguments are quite acceptable in this regard.

119 See, for example, Craig, “Sobel’s Acid Bath for Theism,” 484.
120 Many of these are rehearsed and defended in Pruss, The Principle of Sufficient Reason, Part III.
74
Another alternative is to take the approach of David Lewis in his attempted defense of
modal realism.121 One might justify a commitment to the PSR because of its theoretical
utility i.e. its propensity to solve philosophical problems. For example, the truth of the
PSR would certainly help explain why the universe is so reasonable. That is to say, it
would explain why so much of the time things are explicable, not just in everyday life,
but whenever scientists look hard and long enough for a unified theory of phenomena
that survives careful testing by observation and experiment.
In addition to rejecting the truth of the PSR one might wish to question the idea that the
law of nontriviality requires a sufficient reason. After all, such a law is normally taken to
be a necessary truth, and it is not clear that necessary truths require a sufficient reason.
Recently Pruss has defended a version of the PSR that applies only to contingent truths.
But this is not because he thinks there could not be a requirement here:
There might … be a PSR for necessary propositions. However, investigating such a
PSR will have to await an advance in our understanding of the concepts of
mathematical and philosophical explanation.122
According to Pruss then, our understanding of mathematical and philosophical (and I
assume this includes logical) explanation is much more poorly understood compared
with our understanding of, for example, physical explanation. Until we have a better
understanding, it is safer to limit our commitment to the PSR to contingent truths. Pruss
does, however, have reasons for thinking that there is a PSR for necessary truths,

121 Lewis, On the Plurality of Worlds. This also seems to have been one of the reasons provided for
the PSR by Leibniz – see Blumenfeld, “Leibniz’s Ontological and Cosmological Arguments,” 375.
Leibniz also holds that the PSR is a necessary presupposition of the practice of all the sciences –
Blumenfeld, “Leibniz’s Ontological and Cosmological Arguments,” 375.
122 Pruss, The Principle of Sufficient Reason, 13.
75
specifically that mathematical and philosophical explanations would be rendered ad hoc
if the PSR did not apply to them. Moreover, there are a number of propositions that one
can point to that seem to be necessarily true and yet have reasons or explanations. In
discussing this issue in another context, William Lane Craig points, among other
examples, to the arithmetical truth that 2+3=5. This is necessarily true, and yet it seems
to be true because of the truth of the Peano axioms.
123
Alternatively, one may wish to assume the truth of possibilism and reject the claim that
there are any impossible propositions. Non-triviality then would require a sufficient
reason for why it is true as opposed to false, simply because it being false is possible.
In concluding this brief summary of the attempts to defend the PSR, it must be said that
there is probably more plausibility to this principle than many are willing to give it
credit for. But I will concede that the argument for trivialism presented here will only be
persuasive to the extent that someone is willing to countenance the PSR. However,
anyone who did reject the PSR could not do so in this dialectical context because it leads
to trivialism – that would be straightforwardly question-begging. Moreover, anyone that
does reject the PSR would have to spell out why they find defenses of it and arguments
for its truth to be unconvincing.

123 Craig, Reasonable Faith, 178.

7. Concluding Remarks
There are prima facie good reasons for thinking that trivialism is true. By that I mean that
one can construct arguments with premises that are arguably true and inferences that
are arguably valid. Although it is true that one can produce counter arguments that
attempt to show that the arguments for trivialism commit an error – either by using a
false premise or invalid inference – this is true of the arguments for any interesting and
controversial philosophical position. One should not hold the arguments for trivialism
to a higher standard than one is willing to hold arguments for other philosophical
positions.
In the next chapter I will further strengthen the case for trivialism. I will show that not
only is trivialism rational (given the arguments cited in this chapter) but that it is more
rational than nontrivialism, and indeed, that it is not even possible to be a nontrivialist
(given the most philosophically interesting account of what constitutes a nontrivialist,
i.e. one who denies trivialism). It would seem then, if the arguments of the next chapter
are sound, that there is little motive to reject the premises and inferences of the
arguments presented in this chapter.
77
Chapter 3: On the Impossibility of the Denial of Trivialism
1. Introductory Comments
I am of the opinion that the results of the previous chapter provide one with sufficient
reason for advocating trivialism – the Curry Paradox, the argument from possibilism,
the argument from the CP, and the argument from the PSR all justify belief in trivialism.
However, as I have already mentioned in chapter 2, as with many arguments in
philosophy one could resist the dialectic force of these by disputing the premises or
inferences upon which they are constructed. As such, I wish to supplement with this
chapter further reason for asserting the truth of trivialism, not by providing direct
reasons for believing the truth of trivialism, but rather by undermining the very
possibility of denying trivialism.
To this end I shall begin, in the second section of this chapter, by developing what I
believe is an intuitive account of what it means to deny a given view. After giving
consideration to what might be termed the orthodox account of denial (an account of
denial associated with the tradition of Frege and Quine and others), I argue that to deny
a view is to assert an alternative view. I then begin to develop what is meant by an
alternative view. Rather than construct an exhaustive theory in this regard, I spell out
one of the necessary conditions for an alternative view of a special sort of proposition,
specifically a conjunction. In particular, I show that an alternative proposition to a
conjunction cannot be a conjunct of that conjunction. I only need to go so far in
developing this theory of denial as I later show, in section 3 of the chapter, that
trivialism can be understood as a special kind of conjunction (specifically, it is the
78
conjunction of all propositions) and that this particular necessary condition is not met in
the case of trivialism, as there are no propositions that are not conjuncts of trivialism. As
such there are no propositions that qualify as the alternative view to trivialism, and so
nothing that one can assert that would result in performing the speech act of
nontrivialism (which, to be clear, I define as the assertion of the alternative view to
trivialism).
In section 4 of the chapter I spell out two of the most important implications of the fact
that trivialism is undeniable. The first is that the denial of trivialism cannot be rationally
sustained, because the conclusion to any argument cannot be an alternative to trivialism.
The second is that the opponent of the trivialist, the nontrivialist, does not exist, as there
is no such speech act as nontrivialism. So in the debate between the trivialist and the
nontrivialist, the trivialist wins by default.
Of course, all of this assumes a particular account of the speech act of denial. In section 5
I introduce a recently developed account of denial that has been put forward by
dialetheists such as Graham Priest. According to this account, denial is not reducible to a
special kind of assertion but is rather a sui generis speech act. If this account of denial is
sound, then it would seem to follow that it is possible to deny trivialism. After
examining the main reasons proposed for this account of denial, I suggest reasons for
thinking that it is not entirely satisfactory. I conclude the section by showing that even if
this account is plausible it does little to alleviate the problems facing the nontrivialist.
This is because it will still remain the case (even with this alternative account of denial)
that there is no such assertion that amounts to nontrivialism, and no propositions that
79
one can believe that would make one a nontrivialist. The result of this would be that the
rationality of nontrivialism is still seriously compromised.
1. What does it mean to deny something?
Denial is a speech act along with, but not limited to, other speech acts (or illocutionary
acts) such as assertion, commanding, questioning, and accusing.124 Like all speech acts,
denial necessarily has two components – without both of these being present, there
cannot be a speech act. First, it has a propositional content. Secondly, it has an
illocutionary force with which the proposition is uttered. Searle refers in this regard to
an ‘illocutionary force operator’ and a ‘propositional operator’:
… we can distinguish between two (not necessarily separate) elements in the
syntactical structure of the sentence, which we might call the propositional
operator and the illocutionary force indicator. The illocutionary force indicator
shows how the proposition is to be taken, or to put it another way what
illocutionary force the utterance is to have; that is, what illocutionary act the
speaker is performing in the utterance of the sentence.125
A proposition on its own without illocutionary force plays no role in speech – it does
nothing, so to speak. An illocutionary force without a proposition associated with it has
no content and so says nothing. There is therefore no speech act without both of these
components being present.

124 Sometimes the term ‘speech act’ is used synonymously with the term ‘illocutionary act’. Searle,
for example, distinguishes between illocutionary acts with propositional content (such as an
assertion or command) and illocutionary acts without a content (such as the utterance of ‘ouch’) –
see Searle “What is a Speech Act,” 43. See also Searle, Speech Acts, 30. Others seem to use the term
speech act to include only those things that Searle refers to as illocutionary speech acts with
content. Those illocutionary acts without content are referred to as acts of speech (as opposed to
‘speech acts’) – see for example Green, “Speech Acts.” I will follow Green and take a speech act as
having propositional content.
125 Searle, Speech Acts, 30.
80
Also of relevance for the purposes of this chapter is the fact that one and the same
proposition can be uttered with a different force to give rise to different speech acts.
Take, for example, the proposition ‘the cat sat on the mat’. This can be uttered with the
illocutionary force of an assertion to give rise to the speech act, “the cat is sitting on the
mat.” Alternatively it can be uttered with the force of a question, giving rise to the
speech act, “is the cat sitting on the mat?” Or the proposition could be uttered with the
force of a command: “sit the cat on the mat!” It should also be noted that one can
perform a speech act without actually uttering anything i.e. without actually using
language. A command can be issued with the click of the fingers or a denial by stomping
off in rage or tearing a piece of paper in half. Alternatively one can make an inquiry with
the raising of the eyebrows. But even if one does not actually utter anything, it is still the
case that such a speech act has the same dual nature of a proposition and an
illocutionary force. It is just that sometimes, however, the propositional content is not
actually spoken.
Denial, along with other speech acts, has the dual nature of propositional content and
illocutionary force. To provide a sneak preview of what is to come: I will show that the
denial of trivialism is impossible because necessarily one cannot meet the requirement of
propositional content. Having said that, there are at least two accounts of denial on offer
and they differ in how they characterize the illocutionary force of the speech act, one of
which I will examine in this section and the other I will examine in section 5. The first of
these, which is associated with the tradition of Frege and Geach, characterizes denial as
81
the assertion of the negation of some proposition.126 Quine is certainly one of the
champions of this position:
To deny a statement is to affirm another statement, known as the negation or the
contradictory of the first.127
If I deny that the cat sat on the mat, I am asserting that it is not the case that the cat sat
on the mat. That the denial of p is equivalent to the assertion of ¬p is really the orthodox
view and, as can be seen from the names that have advocated it, has considerable
authority behind it.
There are two main reasons for suspecting that the orthodox account of denial is not the
correct account. First, it seems to be possible to perform a denial without uttering
anything. For example, “… I can shake my head, say ‘no’ or even stomp off in rage.”128
Secondly, it seems that it is possible to assert a negation without performing the speech
act of denial. It seems possible, for example, to assert dialetheism – that is to say it seems
possible to assert that something is both the case and not the case. In such a situation one
is asserting a negation but is not thereby denying the proposition that is negated. Most
dialetheists will assert that the liar sentence (‘this sentence is false’) is true and assert
that it is not the case that the liar sentence is true. They are not thereby denying the truth
of the liar sentence. But aside from dialetheism there seem to be other cases where
someone will want to assert the negation of some proposition without denying it. One
such famous example involves the paradox of the preface.129 The paradox involves a

129 See for example Rescher and Brandom, The Logic of Inconsistency, 47; and Olin, Paradox, 63-5.
82
scenario in which a person has good reasons for asserting some proposition, p, and good
reasons for asserting the negation of this proposition, ¬p. One need not be a dialetheist
by asserting these, as there might be no reason to assert (or indeed good reason to deny)
the truth of the conjunction p∧¬p. Finally, there might be situations in which one wants
to assert the truth of trivialism – as is the case with this thesis. Since this involves
asserting every proposition, it involves asserting the negation of every proposition. But
in doing so, at least according to one of the definitions of a trivialist I am working with
in this thesis, one is not necessarily denying every sentence.130
But the question that I must answer now is: If denial is not to be equated with the
assertion of a negation, what exactly is it then? There is a view that is increasingly
popular (especially among dialetheists) that suggests that denial is not an assertion at
all, and I will examine this in more detail in section 5. However, the view that I prefer is
that a denial of some proposition is the assertion of an alternative proposition. But what
exactly does it mean to assert an alternative proposition? Well, to be honest, I am not
sure that I can say anything very informative about this, as I believe that this is a
fundamental concept that is difficult to develop in any substantial manner. We can all
recognize an alternative view even if we cannot spell out all the necessary and sufficient
conditions for such a thing. However, having said that, I do believe that I can say
something about what an alternative view is with respect to one special class of

130 Although it is true that a trivialist will take herself as denying every proposition in addition to
asserting every proposition – after all, she believes everything, and so she believes that she denies
every proposition.
83
propositions: conjunctions. Specifically, I think it possible to spell out one of the
necessary conditions for being an alternative to a given conjunction.131
What then is the necessary condition for being an alternative to a given conjunction? In
order for some proposition to qualify as an alternative to a given conjunction it is a
necessary condition that the proposition is not a conjunct of the conjunction. In other
words, it is not possible to deny a conjunction by asserting one or more of its conjuncts;
as such a conjunct is not an alternative to the conjunction. To see that you cannot deny a
conjunction by asserting one of its conjuncts, take, for example, the conjunction ‘the ball
is red all over and spherical’. Asserting ‘the ball is red all over’ cannot constitute a
performance of the denial of ‘the ball is red all over and spherical’. Or, to cite an
inconsistent example, one cannot deny the contradiction ‘the ball is red all over and it is
not the case that the ball is red all over’ by claming that ‘it is not the case that the ball is
red all over’.
That it is not possible to deny a conjunction by asserting one or more of its conjuncts is
so obvious that it hardly requires an explanation. But if one were to offer an explanation
for why this is so, one might offer the following. Let’s say that x asserts ‘A and B’ and y
asserts ‘A’. It is clear that y has asserted something that is identical to a part of the
content of x’s assertion (when the conjunction is taken as a whole) or one of x’s
assertions (when the conjunct is taken in isolation), namely ‘A’. But if it is identical to a

131 It turns out that this is all that is required for the purposes of this chapter. As I will show in the
next section, trivialism can be understood as a certain conjunction and, moreover, it does not
satisfy the condition I will spell out below.
84
part of x’s assertion, then it is part of x’s assertion (when this is taken as the conjunction
as a whole) or is one of x’s assertions (when we consider the conjunct in isolation). When
y asserts ‘A’ it is as if x is repeating himself or as if he has a stutter. That is to say, what y
has asserted is not something other than x’s assertion or an alternative to it – it is one of
the assertions of x. But that is just to say that y has not disagreed or disputed or denied
what x has asserted.
Note also that the absence of the assertion of ‘B’ by y does not constitute a disagreement
with x. To think that it does would be the same as thinking that silence demonstrates
disagreement. Silence or the absence of an assertion cannot constitute a disagreement for
the simple fact that silence and the absence of an assertion both lack propositional
content and so are not speech acts (as one of the components required for a speech act is
absent). To actually express a disagreement with x in this case, y would have to assert
something like ‘A only and nothing else’. But note that this is not a conjunct in the
conjunction asserted by x (x is asserting ‘A and B’ and not asserting ‘A only and B’).
A necessary (but not sufficient) condition of a claim expressing a denial of a conjunction
is for it to not be a conjunct of the conjunction. In the case of ‘the ball is red all over and
spherical’ such a denial might be ‘the ball is blue all over’. The proposition ‘the ball is
blue all over’ is not a conjunct of the relevant conjunction and so satisfies this necessary
condition. Likewise for ‘the ball is red all over and it is not the case that the ball is red all
over’. One might deny this conjunction by asserting the proposition ‘the ball is red all
over only and not any other color’ or, alternatively, by asserting the proposition
85
‘contradictions are impossible’. Neither of these is a conjunct of the relevant conjunction
and so both of these also satisfy this necessary condition.
2. The Denial of Trivialism is Impossible
Having spelt out, to a certain extent at least, what constitutes the speech act of denial, we
are now in the position to say what it means to deny trivialism. As with all denials, to
deny trivialism is to assert an alternative view to trivialism. I will give the name ‘altriv’
to whatever is the alternative view to trivialism. The denial of trivialism therefore is the
assertion of altriv. Given this understanding of the denial of trivialism, the question that
this chapter is seeking to answer is this: Is it possible to assert altriv? There can be a
positive answer to this question only if there is such a proposition as altriv. But is there
such a proposition? The answer is a straightforward, no. And because there is no such
proposition as altriv, we can see why the speech act of nontrivialism is impossible: one of
the necessary conditions for such a speech act fails to obtain.
To see this it is important to understand that the propositional content of trivialism is
total. The content of trivialism is equivalent to the totality of the content of all
propositions. That, after all, is why trivialism is thought to be so problematic by the
majority of the philosophical community – the usual objection to trivialism is that the
trivialist should avoid asserting certain kinds of propositions (false propositions or
impossible propositions, for example), i.e. the trivialist supposedly asserts too much.
And because the content of trivialism is total, its assertion amounts to the assertion of
the conjunction of each and every proposition. The trivialist asserts that p1 and p2 and p3
86
etc, are all true. And this in turn is equivalent to the assertion of the conjunction of all
propositions: p1∧p2∧p3∧…
But given that it is a necessary condition for an assertion to be a denial of some
conjunction that it is not a conjunct of the relevant conjunction, it follows that there are
no assertions that can constitute a denial of trivialism. This is because each and every
proposition is a conjunct in the conjunction that expresses trivialism. And so there is no
proposition that can stand in for altriv – the alternative of trivialism. For example, one
does not successfully deny trivialism by asserting ‘it is not the case that trivialism is true’
i.e. by asserting ¬∀pTp.132 Nor can one express a denial of it by claiming ‘trivialism is
incoherent’. Nor can one express a denial of it by pointing out that trivialism is
incompatible with our perceptual experiences.133 All such claims are conjuncts in the
conjunction that expresses trivialism, and so are not suitable candidates for playing the
role of altriv. Each of these is identical to part of the content of trivialism or one of the
assertions of the trivialist. One could only assert a disagreement with trivialism by
asserting a proposition that is not part of the content of trivialism. But there are no such
propositions, as the assertion of trivialism is the assertion of all possible propositions. At
the risk of repeating myself, one cannot assert a position or view such that one has

132 Of course, that one does not necessarily succeed in denying trivialism by asserting the
negation of trivialism is independently supported by the considerations mentioned in section 2,
where I discuss reasons for rejecting the orthodox account of denial. Specifically, that one may
wish to assert a negation of a statement without thereby denying it (as one does in the context of
the paradox of the preface for instance).
133 As is done in Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions.” I will examine this objection in more detail
in chapter 5 of the thesis.
87
performed the speech act of nontrivialism. And again, this is because there is no such
proposition as altriv that one can assert.
Can we Successfully Deny Trivialism using the concept of Material Exclusion?
One might also be tempted at this point to make use of a recent formulation of the Law
of Non-Contradiction (LNC) in order to express a denial of trivialism.134 According to
Berto, there are versions of the LNC that the dialetheist must accept “… without also
accepting something inconsistent with it, on pain of trivialism.”135 Because the dialetheist
accepts the possibility of a true contradiction, it would seem that they have no way of
expressing that they are rejecting some particular contradiction. Berto proposes his
formulation of the LNC in order to enable the dialetheist to overcome this problem. In
effect, Berto is proposing a way in which one can successfully deny trivialism – that is to
say, successfully perform the speech act of nontrivialism. Berto states his version of the
LNC as follows:
For the same thing to hold good and NOT hold good simultaneously of the same
thing and in the same respect is impossible.136
The logical particle NOT is defined as follows: NOT P1(x) =def ∃P2(P2(x) ∧ P1⊥P2), where
⊥ denotes the relation of material exclusion. The idea goes something like this: to say
that something is NOT P1 is to say that it has some property P2 that is materially
exclusive with respect to P1.
137 Another way to put this, perhaps, is to say that something

134 Berto, “Material Exclusion.” See also Berto, How to Sell a Contradiction, 288-316.
135 Berto, “Material Exclusion,” 166.
136 Berto, “Material Exclusion,” 187. Note also that Berto is of view that Aristotle had this in mind
when formulating his version of the LNC in Metaphysics Γ.
137 Berto, “Material Exclusion,” 181.
88
has the property P2 only and not P1. In other words, NOT functions as an ‘only’ clause.
138
According to Berto everyone has a basic intuition of content exclusion – the idea that
some properties exclude others or that some properties are incompatible with others.
The concept of material exclusion, which builds on this intuition, is more fundamental
than such concepts as negation, contrariness, contradictoriness, truth and falsity. Indeed,
these latter concepts may be defined in terms of material exclusion – if someone were so
inclined. Alternatively, as with the dialetheist, they may wish to have the concept of
material exclusion function independently from these in their logic. Material exclusion is
a concept that emerges from our dealings with such things as,
… colour incompatibilities, such as being (solidly) Red and being (solidly) Green;
concepts that express our categorization of physical objects in space and time,
such as x being here right now and x being way over there right now, for a suitably
small x … x being less than two inches long and x being more than three feet long … x’s
catching the bus and x’s missing the bus.
139
Our intuitive feel when dealing with such examples enshrines our sense that some
things are just not possible, period. The examples listed in the above quote are supposed
to appeal even to a dialetheist such as Graham Priest – presumably such a dialetheist
would not admit, for example, that something could have a length of less than two
inches and a length greater than two miles at the same time. Applied to the discussion at
hand, the idea here would be that trivialism can be denied by asserting NOT P, where P
can be any property or predicate. If successful, the making of such an assertion would be
a denial of trivialism, as it would amount to asserting that something failed to be true,

138 Interpreted in this manner, Berto comes close to a proposal made by Littmann, “A Critique of
Dialetheism,” 185-214. Berto also seems to be influenced in this regard by Grim, “What is a
Contradiction,” 63-8. Grim makes use of the particle ‘not’ to denote something much like material
exclusivity.
139 Berto, “Material Exclusion,” 180.
89
namely the proposition ‘property P is instantiated’. Can nontrivialists make use of
Berto’s notion of material exclusion to deny trivialism in this manner?
I wish to suggest that this will not be successful. This is simply because of the fact that
the trivialist herself asserts ‘NOT P’. As such, NOT P is one of the conjuncts of the trivial
conjunction. As such, it will not successfully function as altriv, and so its assertion
cannot amount to a disagreement with the trivialist. The trivialist, along with the
nontrivialist, believes that there are properties that are materially exclusive of one
another. Of course, she also believes that there are no such properties – that all other
properties are compatible with one another. Indeed, for the trivialist, being incompatible
and materially exclusive is just another property that is instantiated in the world. Take
one of the examples cited by Berto in the above quote: an object being solidly red and
blue at the same time. The trivialist believes that this is indeed possible, but she also
believes that such a thing is impossible, as being solidly green and solidly red are
materially exclusive properties. For the trivialist, such properties really do completely
exclude each other (as well as not excluding each other).
Now, one might wish to reply here that the trivialist misunderstands what the notion of
material exclusivity amounts to - that is to say, trivialism is incoherent as it is based on a
faulty notion of material exclusivity. The trivialist only asserts that some things are
materially exclusive because she fails to understand the notion of material exclusivity. If
the trivialist really understood what the notion meant, she would not assert it. It is
simply not the kind of thing that can be both instantiated and not instantiated.
90
But note that asserting this objection will not amount to a denial of trivialism. After all,
that trivialism is based on an incoherent notion of material exclusivity is part of the
content of trivialism, i.e. the proposition, ‘trivialism is based on an incoherent notion of
material exclusivity’ is a conjunct in the trivial conjunction. But in addition, the trivialist
can cite independent argument for thinking that material exclusivity is inherently
contradictory in the way she treats it.140 To see this take the following self-referential
sentence: λ: λ is NOT true. It would seem that λ is both true and NOT true. After all, λ
has either the property of being true or some other property, P, which materially
excludes its being true. If the former, then what it says must be the case and so it has P.
If the latter, then that is what it says, and so it is true. So it has both the property P and
the property of being true. That is to say, a property can be both materially exclusive of
some other property and not so.
So long as NOT P is a genuine proposition, then it is asserted by the trivialist and so
forms part of the content of trivialism. As such, NOT P fails to function as altriv or the
alternative to trivialism. The assertion of NOT P, therefore, does not constitute a denial
of trivialism.

140 Berto is aware that this diagonalization might be possible but does not give it the significance I
do. Rather, he takes it as a possible tu quoque response by the classicist to the dialetheist – see
Berto, “Material Exclusion,” 188 (n. 33). See also Littmann, “A Critique of Dialetheism,” 202-221;
and Littmann & Simmons, “A Critique of Dialetheism,” 330-333, for a similar argument against
dialetheism.
91
Can we Successfully Deny Trivialism using the notion of Conversational Implicature?
I should also make clear at this point that I do not think that one can make use of some
sort of Gricean conversational implicature in order to overcome this problem of being
unable to express a disagreement with trivialism. To illustrate how such a
conversational implicature functions consider this example from Priest:
Suppose you say to me ‘How many siblings do you have’ and I reply ‘I have two
brothers.’ This may be true, but the answer is definitely misleading if the whole
truth is that I have two brothers and one sister. In virtue of my answer, you may
reasonably infer that I have no sisters.141
The idea here is that someone is entitled (by convention) to infer things simply from the
fact that something has been said rather than merely from the content of what has been
said. The idea is that people only provide the relevant information and provide all the
relevant information. Now the question is whether this kind of a convention can be used
to convey that one is denying trivialism by expressing a given proposition (say, the
negation of trivialism, for example). For example, I ask you ‘do you agree with
trivialism?’ and you reply ‘trivialism is false’. Can the convention then enable me to
legitimately infer that you do not also think that trivialism is true? The answer is that it
cannot do this. Indeed, the convention breaks down when it comes to conversations
concerning trivialism.
To see how this is so, consider the example given by Priest in the above quote. Although
there is a miscommunication in this scenario (specifically the listener thinking that the
speaker has no sisters), this is not really a problem. It would not take much for the
misunderstanding to be cleared up. In such a situation more information can and often

141 Priest, In Contradiction, 291.
92
is given to clarify what is being expressed. For example, one can always reply ‘But do
you have any more siblings?’ or ‘Are these the only siblings you have?’ Answers can
then be given to these questions that would express the required information. The
convention works in part because there are available ways to fix any
miscommunications if and when it does break down in this way. As such, people can
afford to put their trust in the convention (indeed what makes it a convention is that it is
trusted). But in the case of trivialism there are no propositions available that could be
used to clear up any misunderstanding or misinformation. There are no propositions
available that would express that someone is claiming that trivialism is false but not also
true. And, once again, this is because all propositions form part of the content of
trivialism. Nothing would be corrected for example if I was to say ‘But trivialism is
incoherent and senseless!’ The content of this assertion does nothing to clarify that I am
not also saying that I think trivialism is true. The convention literally breaks down in an
absolute sense, as there is no way in principle to fix any misinformation. Gricean
conversational implicature works in most contexts but not in conversations where
trivialism is the topic.
3. The Consequences of the Impossibility of the Denial of Trivialism
There are two consequences of the fact that the denial of trivialism (the assertion of
altriv) is impossible: that nontrivialism is irrational; and that there is no opponent for the
trivialist to respond to or justify her position to. I say a little more about each of these in
turn.
93
Given that there is no such speech act as nontrivialism, one wonders what sense can be
given to the idea of there being arguments justifying the speech act of nontrivialism.
This would require having an argument for altriv, the alternative view to trivialism.
Such an argument for altriv would be invalid, as it would have, at best, true premises
leading to a conclusion that failed to be true, as it is contentless. After all, there is no
such proposition as altriv. Once again, rather than trivialism being an odd and
unintuitive view, it is altriv or the alternative view to trivialism that is the odd (and nonexistent) man out among philosophical theories.
It also follows from this that there is no such thing as an objection to trivialism i.e. a
reason for rejecting trivialism or an argument against trivialism. After all, an objection is
a denial of sorts. There have been a number of objections raised against trivialism in
both the literature and in more informal discussion. Some of these I have already
mentioned in the above section. Take, for example, the following objection cited by
Azzouni:
Many philosophers, perhaps most, believe that if ordinary languages did imply
that every sentence is both true and false, then ordinary languages would be
unusable.142
It is not clear here what ‘usable’ is supposed to mean. But whatever one means by
‘usable’, the argument can perhaps be expressed as follows143:
1. If trivialism were true, then natural language would be unusable.

142 Azzouni, “The Strengthened Liar,” 343.
143 It is not clear to me that this is the correct way to interpret this so called argument against
trivialism. The point being raised by Azzouni may not even be an objection to the truth of
trivialism. Rather, it might be better interpreted as an argument against the possibility of
believing in trivialism, regardless of its truth. I will be dealing with this issue, and so this
interpretation of Azzouni, in chapter 4 of the thesis.
94
2. But natural language is usable
3. Therefore, it is not the case that trivialism is true.
But the fact is that the assertion of propositions 1-3 cannot constitute a denial of
trivialism. By citing such propositions one simply has not succeeded in expressing a
denial of trivialism. Those who put forward these propositions as an argument against
trivialism have thought that they have succeeded in performing such a linguistic act –
but they are mistaken. They have failed simply because of the fact that 1-3 are all
conjuncts in the trivial conjunction that is trivialism, and so not alternatives to trivialism.
They are part of the content of trivialism. The speech act that advocates of 1-3 succeed at
is not the denial of trivialism – it is, rather, the assertion of part of the content of
trivialism.
All of the supposed arguments against trivialism are constructed from propositions that
are conjuncts in the trivial conjunction and so cannot be objections to trivialism in the
sense of denials of trivialism. Upon hearing them it is not proper for the trivialist to try
and reply to them by showing where these have committed some error of fact or
reasoning. For example, Azzouni attempts to reply to the above argument by suggesting
that users of the natural language avoid the triviality by instituting a regimentation
procedure in which inconsistent propositions are isolated off from one another.144
Whatever the merits of such a proposal, it seems to display a lack of appreciation for the
logic of debate in this dialectical context. There is no problem to be solved here by the
trivialist. No one has succeeded in expressing a denial of trivialism by asserting 1-3. This

144 Azzouni, “The Strengthened Liar,” 343-347.
95
applies to all arguments against trivialism: trivialism is to be rejected because it entails
its own incoherence; trivialism is to be rejected because it entails impossible
propositions; trivialism is to be rejected because it entails that the observable world is
inconsistent. None of these assertions express a denial of trivialism, and so there is
nothing for the trivialist to respond to.145
So much for the first implication – what though of the second implication? In his paper
“Could Everything Be True?” Priest, after noting the peculiarities of the debate with the
trivialist, attempts to articulate a dialectical setting in which trivialism can be
successfully debated. Rather than attempting to debate directly with a trivialist (which
he concludes is pointless because the trivialist will agree with everything you say), he
makes the following suggestion
It makes more sense to ask how one would justify one’s view to some
independent third party, an arbiter. The third party may be supposed to be
neutral on the issue, at least initially. The job for each of the first two parties is to
persuade them. The arbiter will listen to arguments from each side, and, if
convinced by either party, will judge in their favour.146
Priest claims the nontrivialist can win the argument in such a dialectical setting. The
nontrivialist does this by showing the neutral arbiter that the trivialist does not even
exist. I will examine Priest’s arguments for this conclusion in chapter 4, and give reasons
for thinking that they are less than convincing. But in this section I wish to flesh out

145 This is not to say that these arguments fail to express a denial of something. The last of these I
think expresses a denial of the claim that the observable world is inconsistent. I will be analyzing
this argument given this interpretation of it in chapter 5. But, as I hope to show, there are reasons
to think it fails to be convincing even in such a dialectical context.
146 Priest, “Could Everything Be True?,” 190.
96
some of the consequences of the fact that nontrivialism is impossible for the dialectical
context set up by Priest.
There are in fact two consequences. First, it would appear that the arbiter should
conclude that trivialism is the rational view and altriv (the view being asserted by the
nontrivialist) the irrational view. This is because, as I have already pointed out above,
altriv fails to have content, and so any arguments for it are in fact invalid – the premises
will lead to a conclusion that fails to be true (as it lacks content and so lacks true
content). On the other hand there are, as I have shown in the previous chapter, arguably
sound arguments in favor of the truth of trivialism. The arbiter should therefore declare
the trivialist the winner of the debate.
In addition, the arbiter should declare the trivialist the winner of the debate by default.
Why is this so? Well, altriv fails to have any propositional content. As such, it is not
something that can be believed, for what would it be that one is assenting to? It has no
content to which one can assent to! And if it cannot be believed in, then there is no one
that believes it. In the courtroom of the debate between the trivialist and the
nontrivialist, the nontrivialist has failed to even appear. Indeed, it is impossible for him
to appear. There is literally no such thing as a nontrivialist – he does not exist. The
arbiter is therefore compelled to rule the trivialist the winner of the debate, because the
trivialist has no opponent. Those who claim to be the opponent of the trivialist are
simply mistaken. They have failed to understand that the content of trivialism is total.
When one asserts trivialism, there is literally nothing else to assert that is other than
97
trivialism. All such a person can do is continue citing the never-ending litany of the
content of trivialism. All they can do is help themselves to the assertions of the trivialist.
4. What if denial is a sui generis speech act?
There is an alternative account of denial to the orthodox account and the one I favor in
this chapter. This alternative account of denial rejects the claim that denial can be
reduced to an assertion of some sort – whether this is the assertion of a negation (on the
orthodox account) or the assertion of an ‘alternative’ view (as with my account). On this
account, denial is a sui generis speech act.147 To deny something then is to apply an
illocutionary force directly to a proposition, without this force being assertive. Take, for
example, the proposition, ‘Australia should be a republic’. On this account of denial, to
deny this is to apply the force of denial directly to the proposition ‘Australia should be a
republic’. Although it should be noted that, on this account, it is also possible to deny
this proposition by uttering the negation of this proposition – i.e. by uttering ‘it is not the
case that Australia should be a republic’. It is just that on this account it is not necessary
to utter the negation of a proposition in order to deny a proposition.
Applied to the context at hand, the nontrivialist may wish to take the position that the
denial of trivialism is quite possible given this account of denial. The problem is that
trivialism can be defined as the conjunction of all propositions, and it is this fact that
prevents one from denying trivialism by asserting something – there is no proposition,
altriv, left over to assert. But on this account of denial, one does not assert anything

147 Priest, Doubt Truth to be a Liar, 105-106.
98
when denying trivialism. Rather, one is applying the sui generis illocutionary force of
denial to the proposition that is the conjunction of all propositions (i.e. trivialism itself).
In this section, I will make two responses to this account of the denial of trivialism. First,
I will give reason for thinking that it is not the case that denial is a sui generis speech act
that cannot be reduced to an assertion. Secondly, I will argue that even if we grant that
this is an acceptable account of denial and that it enables one to deny trivialism, the
victory of the nontrivialist will be rather limited. It will still be the case that there is
nothing that one can assert that will result in the performance of the speech act of
nontrivialism, nor any proposition that one can believe in that would make one a
nontrivialist.
Is Denial a Sui Generis Speech Act?
But what of this alternative account of denial – should we accept that denial is a sui
generis speech act? I am inclined to side with orthodoxy on this matter and say that it is
not. Of course, I agree that a denial of a proposition is not necessarily the assertion of the
negation of that proposition, but I do think that it is the assertion of something – the
assertion of an alternative view or proposition or position. What then are the main
reasons for claiming that denial is a sui generis speech act? The main reason would seem
to be this: it would seem that we can perform the speech act of denial without uttering
anything, and so if we do not utter anything, it must be the case that nothing has been
asserted. Priest provides three examples of this in the above quote in section 2: shaking
one’s head, saying ‘no’, and stomping off in a rage. Supposedly, such examples show us
that denial is a speech act that is not reducible to an assertion – presumably because they
do not involve the utterance of anything.
99
Now I am inclined to think (and this is by no means a conclusive reason) that such cases
either do involve an assertion of something or they do not even constitute speech acts at
all (as they have no propositional content). Recall that a speech act does not necessarily
involve actually uttering anything explicitly. I suspect that this is often so with the
examples of this sort cited by Priest. In such cases, the person is actually asserting
something but they are merely failing to explicitly say so. For example, take a scenario in
which my employer points out to me that I was late for work this morning (work begins
at 8.30 a.m.), and I respond with the shake of the head and at the same time I am
thinking something like, “I turned up before 8 a.m.” Here we have an assertion but it
remains hidden within my thoughts. Another example: My wife constantly nags me
about not spending enough time with the kids, and I eventually stomp off in rage,
thinking very loudly in my head, “I was with them all last week!” Again we have an
assertion but it remains hidden within my thoughts.
But when such acts do not involve the person having hidden thoughts of the sort that I
am describing, it seems to me that such acts cannot be considered bona fide speech acts.
This is because they may not involve any propositional content at all, and having
propositional content is a necessary condition for an act to qualify as a speech act. Such
responses might plausibly involve scenarios in which the person is reacting in a more or
less instinctive manner to highly emotive and stress-inducing accusations. We can all
recall situations in which we have reacted in such a manner – in what appears to be a
denial – but later reflect on the situation and cannot say exactly what we were thinking.
100
In such situations we have a misfired or aborted speech act – what might have been a
denial if we indeed had asserted something.
In addition to these considerations, I also think that it is very difficult to make sense of
the idea that one can deny a given proposition by uttering its negation, given the claim
that denial is sui generis. If I utter “it is not the case that the cat sat on the mat,” then this
has all the appearances of an assertion. After all, the one who utters “it is not the case
that the cat sat on the mat” presumably believes that this is true. But in that case it must
be something that they are asserting, as they have made an utterance the content of
which is something they ascent to. Moreover, this utterance will cause the listener to
think that the one uttering this is asserting this content. It would appear in this case then
that the denial is achieved by an assertion – the assertion of a negation. But if denial is
really sui generis, then it is an entirely different kind of speech act from assertion. If they
really are different from one another, then how can one be performed by performing the
other? Other speech acts are also sui generis with respect to assertion and yet one cannot
perform these by issuing an assertion. Take, for example, the speech act of commanding.
It does not seem possible to issue a command by performing an assertion. If I assert “the
cat sat on the mat” I am not thereby commanding anything, nor could I. In virtue of
being an assertion such a thing fails to be a command. And yet if I assert “it is not the
case that the cat sat on the mat” I can thereby quite successfully deny that the cat is
sitting on the mat. But this possibility is difficult to make sense of given the claim that
denial is a different kind of speech act to assertion, i.e. that it is sui generis. Hence, I think
that a denial of a proposition is an assertion of something.
101
Now I am aware that the objections I have raised against the sui generis account are
hardly conclusive. The advocate of this account will probably respond by insisting that it
just seems to them, on the basis of introspection, that when they deny something they
are applying an illocutionary force to some proposition that does not amount to
assertion – they are, for example, saying “no” to a specific proposition, and not asserting
anything. So, for example, the denial of trivialism will have as its propositional content
trivialism itself, and that nothing is thereby asserted in denying trivialism. I accept that
one cannot just dismiss a response of this sort. But even if this is a plausible account of
denial per se, it is far from clear that this will be of much comfort to the nontrivialist.
Is this much of a Victory for the Nontrivialist?
But let us grant that denial is a sui generis speech act. Does it follow that the nontrivialist
can rest contented with the thought that they have won a victory against the trivialist in
this regard?
I wish to suggest that it would not. This is because on such an account of denial,
nontrivialism will only ever amount to a mere denial. That is to say, one cannot assert a
position that amounts to the performance of the speech act of nontrivialism. Again, to
labor the point, there is no content to such an assertion for the reasons cited in section 3,
specifically every proposition forms part of the content of trivialism. But this makes the
denial of trivialism very queer. Assuming that denial is sui generis, it still seems that we
should be able to utter some position or view or proposition that amounts to a denial
even if this is not necessary. Take for example the denial of the proposition, ‘the cat sat
on the mat’. According to the view at hand, we deny this by applying the illocutionary
102
force of denial to that very proposition. For example, if someone says to us “the cat sat
on the mat” we can deny this by responding with “no”. However, it seems that it is
possible to deny this by uttering, “it is not the case that the cat sat on the mat,” or by
uttering, “cats never sit on mats they only walk by them.” For the denial of any other
proposition, we seem to be able to utter some other proposition or view that will be an
alternative to, and so a denial of, that proposition. But this is not the case for the denial
of trivialism. We can never utter any view or proposition that will qualify as having
performed the speech act of nontrivialism. That is to say, we cannot ever assert anything
such that this assertion functions as a denial of trivialism. On the sui generis view, the
nontrivialist is merely someone who keeps shaking his head or uttering “no” when
confronted with trivialism – there is nothing more he can say. But I think that this is
good reason to treat the denial of trivialism with deep suspicion. Such a speech act can
hardly constitute a viable and sophisticated philosophical position. Indeed, it is not a
position at all, as nothing has been asserted.
What though of the issue of the debate between the trivialist and the nontrivialist? Will
the arbiter declare the trivialist winner? If denial is a sui generis speech act, then it seems
that it is not the case that the trivialist will necessarily be declared the winner of the
debate by the arbiter, and this is so for two reasons. First, on this account of denial, the
trivialist cannot win by default – a denial of trivialism is quite possible, and so the
nontrivialist does appear at the table of debate. Secondly, if denial is sui generis, then it
seems quite possible that such a speech act could be rational. Indeed, there are reasons
that have been proposed for denying trivialism that are quite compatible with this
account of denial. Such arguments attempt to show that belief in trivialism is not
103
possible, as it is incompatible with discriminating and purposeful behavior. It certainly
seems to me that if such arguments are sound, then they might be good reason for
denying trivialism (again assuming that one can make sense of denial as sui generis) –
although I suspect that at most they will only show that trivialism cannot be asserted,
and not that it is rational to deny trivialism. Now I will devote the next chapter (chapter
4) of the thesis to examining these arguments, and I will conclude that it is less than clear
that they are sound. As such, it would seem that they will not render the denial of
trivialism rational, and so although the trivialist will not win the debate by default, she
will win on points if not a knockout.
But having said this, even if these arguments of the nontrivialist are sound, thus making
a sui generis denial of trivialism rational, it is still the case that the nontrivialist will not
be able to justify a theory or position or worldview or whatnot that amounts to altriv or
the alternative of trivialism. Again, nontrivialism will amount to a mere denial even if
this is rational. I wish to suggest that the arbiter would be very reluctant to award a
victory to the nontrivialist given that the nontrivialist cannot propose an account of
reality that differs, in the sense of being an alternative account, from that of the trivialist.
Any worldview he attempts to develop in order to spell out his rational denial of
trivialism will be parasitic on the worldview of the trivialist – just part of what the
trivialist claims and not an alterative to it.
5. Concluding Remarks
In summary: trivialism is the claim that all propositions are true. Nontrivialism is the
denial of trivialism. Because the content of trivialism is total, the alternative of trivialism
104
is contentless, i.e. it has null content. And so there is no such speech act as the assertion
of an alternative view to trivialism, and so no such speech act as the denial of trivialism.
This seems to me to be sufficient reason to accept and assert trivialism. Not only is it
rational (given the arguments defended in chapter 2) but altriv (the alternative of
trivialism) is irrational and unbelievable. There cannot be reasons for something that
lacks propositional content, nor can one believe such a thing. In an argument with the
nontrivialist, the trivialist wins by default – she can have no such opponent. In addition,
the trivialist has little to fear from the view that denial is a sui generis speech act. Even if
such a view were a plausible account of denial, and there are reasons to even doubt this
much, there is still no view that amounts to the alternative of trivialism and there can be
no justification for something that cannot be asserted (again putting aside for now the
arguments that will be addressed in the next chapter).
Before moving to the next chapter it is important to mention that there are available
other accounts of what it is to be a nontrivialist beside the one examined in this chapter.
This chapter has shown that it is not possible to be a nontrivialist in the sense of
someone who performs the speech act of denying trivialism. But one could be a
nontrivialist in a ‘quietist’ sense. Specifically, one could be a nontrivialist in the sense of
believing or asserting some propositions as opposed to all propositions. But it is not
possible to understand this quietist sense of being a nontrivialist as somehow in
opposition to the trivialist. After all, such a person only asserts and believes things that
the trivialist asserts and believes. As such there is no sense in which they have been
successful at disputing what the trivialist claims about the world. But this is the best that
a nontrivialist can do in distinguishing himself from the trivialist.

Chapter 4: Is it Possible to Believe in Trivialism?
1. Is it Possible to Believe in Trivialism?
The previous two chapters argued that not only should we not attempt to deny
trivialism (because such a speech act is impossible), but that we should assert it as well.
That is to say, we should believe that trivialism is true. But the denial of trivialism has
also been defended on the grounds that even if trivialism were true, it would be
psychologically impossible to believe that it is true. That it is unbelievable has been
defended by at least two arguments from the history of philosophy. The first, and a very
ancient argument, is from Aristotle’s Metaphysics Γ. The second is a more contemporary
argument based on the phenomenology of choice, proposed by Graham Priest. In this
chapter I put forward three possible responses to these arguments. These responses are
quite independent of one another and I do not favor one over the others. My aim is
merely to show how one might begin to build a plausible response to both Aristotle and
Priest, and thus show that it is possible to believe in trivialism.
In the first response to Aristotle I will defend and develop a proposal made by Priest.
According to Priest we can account for the discriminating action of the trivialist by the
fact that she has been conditioned to act in certain ways but not in others. The idea here
is that belief is not enough to account for action – desire also plays a role. But it is quite
compatible with the definition of a trivialist that she has only some desires and not
others.
107
On the other hand my first response to Priest’s argument is to make two suggestions.
First, I argue that, contra Priest, it is possible for the trivialist to form the intent and
desire to bring about some state of affairs she already believes obtains. Secondly, I argue
that one can account for the purposeful action of a trivialist by diverging somewhat
from the orthodox account of action in terms of belief and desire. I essentially make a
suggestion as to how we might be able to account for the actions of the trivialist purely
in terms of the beliefs of the trivialist regardless of the fact that she has no desires or
intentions.
In the second response to Aristotle and Priest I put forward an alternative
understanding of what it is to be a trivialist – one that seems to avoid the problems cited
by Priest and Aristotle, and yet is still philosophically interesting.148 I suggest that there
is a straightforward sense of what it is to be a trivialist that does not even require one to
believe each and every proposition. An obvious objection that might be raised against
this response is this: surely this position would entail that the trivialist is irrational, as
there are beliefs she does not have and yet should have given that they are
straightforwardly entailed by her trivialism. I show why this objection is mistaken in as
much as it has a distorted view of rationality.
In the final response I take up a suggestion from Hume in his A Treatise of Human Nature
that belief is merely a matter of a relatively stronger affection toward a certain object of
thought. This allows that even if one believed every proposition there might be enough

148 And, of course, this means that I would be willing to modify my definition of a trivialist as
articulated in section 1 of chapter 1.
108
differentiation between these beliefs, as a result of a differentiation of affection, to enable
discrimination and purposeful behavior. Of course, this response relies on one taking a
view of the nature of belief relevantly similar to that proposed by Hume, but, as I
suggest, this is not overly controversial.
In the conclusion to the chapter I discuss the implications for belief in trivialism given
that we accept that the arguments of Priest and Aristotle are sound. Among other
suggestions, I forward the idea that even if it is not possible to literally believe each and
every proposition (on pain of extinguishing ones existence as a personal agent), belief in
trivialism could represent some sort of spiritual goal for the trivialist.
Before spelling out in more detail the arguments of Priest and Aristotle, I wish to say a
little about another difficulty someone may have with the possibility of belief in
trivialism. It might be thought that belief in trivialism is not compatible with all theories
of the nature of belief. For example, if one were to hold that beliefs were actual mental
states that exist in a ‘belief box’ somewhere in the mind, and that the mind (perhaps
because it is grounded in a finite physical brain) can only have a finite number of beliefs
in this box, then it would appear that belief in trivialism is not possible. On this account
of belief, belief in trivialism would require a belief box with an infinite number of beliefs,
which mere humans could not possibly have.
I have two things to say in response to these concerns. First, even if this account of belief
is true, then it still will not follow that no one can believe in trivialism. Certainly, if
humans were purely physical creatures with a brain of finite processing capabilities
109
(analogous to a computer of some sort), then belief in trivialism would be impossible.
But physicalism of this sort might not be a true account of the human mind. There are
available in the market place of ideas accounts of the human mind that will allow for
belief in trivialism – certain versions of substance dualism (such as is found in Jainism)
and monistic idealism (such as is found perhaps in Hegel or Advaita Vedanta).
Secondly, and more importantly, it is not clear to me that the ‘box’ theory of beliefs is
correct anyway. I myself prefer a dispositional account of belief. On this account, to have
a belief is just to have the disposition to behave in a certain manner. For example, to
believe that chocolate is delicious is just to be disposed to answer ‘yes’ to the question
‘do you think that chocolate is delicious?’ when this is asked of oneself. On this account
one does not actually need an infinite information processing capacity in order to
believe in trivialism. Rather, it just requires one to have the rights sorts of dispositions.
2. Is Belief in Trivialism Compatible with Discriminating Behavior?
Metaphysics Γ contains the most sustained attack on trivialism ever written.149 There are a
number of arguments presented in this book but it is not implausible to say that the
most convincing is an argument that is directed at the possibility of belief in trivialism
based on the actions of the one who purports to believe in trivialism (unlike Aristotle’s
other arguments which are directed at the question of either the truth of trivialism or the
truth of dialetheism). The argument makes the important observation that those who

149 Although most of the arguments presented by Aristotle are directed against a denial of the
Law of Nontriviality, Aristotle and subsequent defenders of the arguments seem to treat them as
arguments opposing a denial of the Law of Non-Contradiction. In other words, such arguments
are mistakenly interpreted as being arguments against the belief in true contradictions simpliciter
rather than arguments opposing the belief that all contradictions are true. See Priest, “What’s so
Bad about Contradictions?” 29.
110
claim to be trivialists are very careful about what they do. Their behavior is deliberate
and purposeful and discriminating. As Aristotle points out in a most colorful manner:
For why does anyone walk to Megara rather than stay where he is, when he
considers that he should walk there? Why does he not proceed one morning
straight into a well or over a precipice, if there is one about: instead of
evidently taking care to avoid doing so, as one who does not consider that
falling in is equally a good thing and not a good thing? It is consequently
plain that he believes that one thing is better, another not better. And if so, he
must also believe that one thing is a man and another not a man, one thing
sweet and another not sweet. For he neither seeks nor believes everything
indifferently when, considering that it is better to drink water and see a man,
he thereupon seeks to do so; and yet he ought to, if the same thing were
equally a man and not a man. But just as we said, there is nobody who does
not evidently take care to avoid some things and not others; so that it seems
that everyone holds some beliefs boldly, if not about everything then about
what is better and worse.150
When we observe the behavior of the trivialist (Aristotle is of the, probably mistaken,
opinion that both Heraclitus and Anaxagoras are trivialists) it is clear that, like everyone
else, they behave in a rather discriminating and purposeful manner. But behaving in
such a manner is not compatible with being a trivialist. Hence, such a person does not
really believe in trivialism, nor could they given that it is impossible for a person to
avoid acting in a discriminating manner (an assumption I question below).
This argument has usually been taken to be a convincing refutation of the believability
of trivialism. There are two distinct premises in this argument. First, the trivialist
behaves in a discriminating and purposeful manner. Secondly, that such discriminating
and purposeful behavior is incompatible with being a trivialist. As it stands this
argument is actually ambiguous. Aristotle could be making one of two claims when he
indicates that the so-called trivialist behaves in a discriminating and purposeful manner.

150 Aristotle, Metaphysics, Books Γ, ∆, and Ε , 15.
111
First, he could be saying that a person chooses something and has this as the purpose of
their act, and it is this choosing of something that is incompatible with being trivialist. In
other words, having a purpose at all is incompatible with believing everything.
Alternatively he could be indicating that a person chooses one course of action over another
and this is incompatible with being trivialist. Or in other words, preferring one purpose
to another is incompatible with believing everything.
I will assume in this section that it is the latter of these interpretations that is correct. I
will examine the former in the next section when I critique Priest’s argument against
belief in trivialism. What do we make of the latter interpretation of Aristotle’s argument?
Is it the case that the trivialist cannot account for the fact that we are all discriminating in
our choices, that by preferring one course of action to another, we could not possibly be
trivialists? Given the option of eating bread and eating glass, the trivialist cannot
account for why they choose one option over the other, in the sense that they have no
reason that justifies why they have chosen one option over the other – they can have no
motive for performing one act over another.
But what would be wrong if the trivialist gave the following reason for choosing the
bread over the glass: “If I eat the bread, I will obtain nutrition and live. However, I
might make myself very ill indeed if I eat the glass?” Presumably the problem with
answering in this way goes as follows. The trivialist believes that one can actually
receive just as much nutrition from eating glass as eating bread. Indeed, the trivialist
believes that eating bread is just as damaging to ones health as eating glass. So, the
trivialist can have no reason for preferring one to the other. In other words, there is no
112
basis for the trivialist to be discriminating. One cannot choose x over y because of z, as z
will be satisfied by either x or y (for the trivialist that is). The implication of this is that
the trivialist would be suspended between x and y and be unable to choose either. The
trivialist is therefore, according to this objection, the ultimate Buridan’s ass who died of
starvation between two bails of hay because he could not discriminate between them,
and so could not choose one over the other.
Before spelling out my response to Aristotle’s argument against belief in trivialism, it is
worth mentioning an alternative interpretation of an argument mentioned in section 4 of
chapter 3. It seems to me that Aristotle’s objection provides us with another
interpretation of the objection to trivialism mentioned by Azzouni:
Many philosophers, perhaps most, believe that if ordinary languages did imply
that every sentence is both true and false, then ordinary languages would be
unusable.151
It is not clear what ‘usable’ means in this passage but one suggestion emerges from
Bueno:
But how can the trivialist explain why it is that it simply doesn’t seem as though
English (among other natural languages) is trivial? In other words, why is it that
not every sentence of English seems to be true? What is the reason why we seem
to be able to distinguish so clearly true sentences from false ones (except perhaps
in cases of vagueness and semantically defective sentences)?152
‘Usable’ then would seem to mean the practice of being able to distinguish true
sentences from false ones. But one can make an even stronger point than Bueno does
here. For the trivialist, not only is every proposition in natural language both true and
false, but every proposition is of identical content to every other proposition. The point

151 Azzouni, “The Strengthened Liar,” 343. See note 32 in chapter 1.
152 Bueno, “Troubles with Trivialism,” 658.
113
then given Aristotle’s argument is that because all propositions are identical (both in
content and truth value) for the trivialist, she cannot practice actions such as choosing
some propositions over others. They are all the same for the trivialist and so
indistinguishable. For example, the trivialist would be unable to communicate an
instruction to someone. This is because the trivialist believes that any set of words will
do for such an act of communication (they do after all have identical meanings) and so
could not have a reason for choosing one set over another. I will, however, argue below
that it is possible for natural language to be usable in the relevant sense given belief in
trivialism. The trivialist can act in a manner that is discriminating.
3. First Response to Aristotle
Graham Priest points out that Aristotle’s argument can be easily dealt with in a manner
that is parallel to the responses given by skeptics to similar objections to their own
views:
[The trivialist] … may claim that when they reach for the bread, it is not because
they do not believe that glass would be just as good. It is simply because they
have been trained to do so.153
The trivialist chooses one thing over another because they are conditioned to do so, not
because they have reasons that discriminate one course of action over the other. The
trivialist then will eat the bread simply because she is well trained. It is out of habit that
she makes such a choice. It should not be thought, however, that it is necessarily the case
that this habit be formed through a process of acculturation (such as education or
propaganda or some other social force). Many of our acts can be understood as

153 Priest, “Could Everything be True,” 193-4.
114
stemming from the nature of the wider world including our biological constitution. One
can think of a Darwinian explanation in this regard – humans in the past (whether they
were trivialists or not) who had a tendency to eat glass died out, but those who tended
to avoid this survived and went on to reproduce and pass on such tendencies to their
offspring. The reason then why trivialists favor some courses of action over others is to
be explained much in the same way we explain this in other humans.154
I think that this response does indeed show that a trivialist can choose one course of
action over another without there being reasons on behalf of the trivialist for doing so.
Thus choosing one course of action over another is compatible with being a trivialist.
The trivialist can account for why they choose, although this will not be in terms of a
justifying reason according to Priest. The point being made by Priest is that there are
factors other than belief that determine acts of discrimination (such as desires or
neurological structures or cultural and social forces), and that these factors will serve as
discriminators even when belief will not. Note also that this reply to Aristotle’s
argument is quite compatible with a trivialist citing reasons for why she has chosen one
course of action over another. After all, she may simply be unaware of the actual causes
behind the discrimination that has taken place. Indeed, this is probably true of most
humans whether they be trivialists or not. Often we are unaware of the actual causes of
our behavior.

154 Note also that one need not understand the habits of the trivialist in terms of having stemmed
from some desire or another. It might be true that enculturation or biological constitution explain
the discriminating actions of the trivialist via the concept of desire. On this view the trivialist has
been acculturated or biologically programmed to have desires for certain ends and not for others.
But the habits need not be explained at that level at all. They may be explained at a purely
neurological level without reference to desire – a sort of reflex action, so to speak, caused by the
firing of certain nerves.
115
Although Priest has offered the above reply as a solution to Aristotle’s argument, he
suspects that Aristotle has not located the real difficulty here for the trivialist, and that
there is a far more fundamental issue at stake. To see what this is I will now turn to
Priest’s argument against the possibility of belief in trivialism. According to Priest, the
problem is not so much that a trivialist cannot act with discrimination, but rather that a
trivialist cannot even form an intention or desire required in order to perform an act.
4. Is Belief in Trivialism Compatible with Purposeful Behavior?
Graham Priest has developed the alternative interpretation of Aristotle’s critique that
belief in trivialism is incompatible with having any purpose, with his own argument
based on the phenomenology of human choice. That we know that the trivialist is acting
in a purposeful manner follows directly from considerations of what it is to be a being
that can choose. That acting in such a manner is incompatible with being a trivialist
follows from considerations concerning the relationship between belief and choice. As
with the previous argument from Aristotle there is an assumption that in order to be a
trivialist one has to believe the truth of every possible individual claim or proposition
implied by ‘everything is true’.
The first step in Priest’s argument involves establishing that it is not possible for the
trivialist to act purposefully. The reason for this is that it is not possible to intend to
bring about a state of affairs if one believes that this state of affairs is already the case:
One cannot intend to act in such a way as to bring about some state of affairs, s, if
one believes s to already hold. Conversely, if one acts with the purpose of
116
bringing s about, one cannot believe that s already obtains. Hence, if one believes
that everything is true, one cannot act purposefully.155
And of course, the trivialist believes that every state of affairs obtains. But, claims Priest,
it is clear that we all act with purpose. We know this because it follows directly from the
phenomenology of consciousness: “… as long as a person is conscious, they make a
choice … having to choose is something phenomenologically unavoidable”.156 And to
choose is to have a purpose of some sort, “… to (try to) bring about this rather than
that”.157 The so-called trivialist, because she is conscious, acts with purpose, and because
acting with purpose is incompatible with believing everything, she is not really a
trivialist at all. Priest concludes: “… it is quite possible that everything is the case, but
not for me – or for any other person”.158
There might be a number of ways that one could respond to Priest’s argument. One such
way is to insist that human choice is not motivated by any purpose at all. Rather, it is
completely spontaneous and groundless. This, of course, is quite a radical way out of
Priest’s objection and not one that I recommend. After all, some choices might be
spontaneous and groundless in this sense but it is difficult to imagine that all of them
could be like this. Certainly, the phenomenology of our choices tells strongly against this
position – it just seems to be, when we examine our acts of choice, that they are based on
motivating purposes.

5. First Response to Priest
To see how one might begin to build a response to Priest it is worth focusing on that part
of his argument in which he claims that one cannot intend to act so as to bring about
some state of affairs if one believes that this state of affairs already obtains. This raises
the obvious question as to why exactly one could not do this. Indeed, during the
development of his argument, Priest raises what might be thought to be an obvious
objection to this claim:
It might be retorted if one believes that everything is the case, one believes that s
is not the case, and so one can intend to bring it about.159
But Priest replies in the following way:
Normally, it is true, someone who believes ¬s does not believe s; and so
believing ¬s allows one to have the intention of bringing s about. But for the
trivialist, ¬s does not rule out s; hence these considerations do not apply. The
trivialist cannot aim to bring about s, because it is simply part of a situation that
(they think) already obtains, viz., s∧¬s.
160
The core idea here is that it does not even seem intelligible to say that the agent in
question can have the intention to bring s about if they believe that s obtains. Perhaps
another way to put this is to say that one can not make sense of the agent having a desire
to bring s about if they believe that s already obtains. Presumably it is thought that it is a
necessary condition for intending or desiring to bring about some state of affairs that
one does not believe that the state of affairs already obtains. The idea here is that the

159 Priest, “Could Everything be True,” 194.
160 Priest, “Could Everything be True,” 194.
118
desire or intention has already been satisfied, so to speak, and so the conditions for the
performing the act are absent. And, of course, the trivialist does believe that the state of
affairs already obtains. So she cannot have the required intention or desire, and so it
makes no sense to say that she can act to bring about that state of affairs in question.

How then can we make intelligible the idea of an agent bringing about s even though
she believes that s obtains? What is required here is either to find a way of showing that a
trivialist can desire or intend some state of affairs despite believing that the state of
affairs in question obtains (contrary to Priest’s intuitions), or to show that the trivialist
has something that takes the place of an intention or desire that functions to make such
an act intelligible. I will now examine each of these possibilities in turn.
With respect to the first of these, can we find an intelligible account of how a trivialist
can form the intention or desire to bring s about even though she already believes that s
obtains? I wish to suggest the following possible scenario, involving the fictional
characters Jenny and Bret, to show that such a thing is indeed intelligible. The scenario is
as follows. Jenny believes that Bret does not love her. However, she desires and intends
to bring it about that Bret loves her. In the process of courting Bret over a period of time,
and as a result of the fact that she so desperately desires Bret to love her, Jenny comes to
believe, through a process of self-deception and wishful thinking, that it is indeed the
case that Bret loves her. Of course, in addition she also believes that Bret does not love
her – that is, she has contradictory beliefs.
119
Now it seems to me that this is a perfectly possible situation. Moreover, in this situation
we have an agent, Jenny, who believes that some situation obtains (that Bret loves her),
and yet intends and desires to bring it about that this very same situation obtains. It
would seem then that it is indeed possible for an agent to believe that s obtains and yet
intend and desire to bring it about that s obtains. As such, it would appear that it is
possible for the trivialist to intend or desire to bring about some state of affairs, even
though she believes that this already obtains. The key in this possible scenario is that the
intention and desire (that Bret love Jenny) is prior to the formulation of the belief in
question (that Bret does indeed love Jenny). Indeed, the intention and desire in question
contributes to bringing about the belief in question (via a complex process of selfdeception). It is possible that there is a similar structure and history among the desires
and beliefs of the trivialist. One can envisage a scenario in which someone begins her life
as a nontrivialist (i.e. believing some things and not others), but over a long period of
time, through complex paths of self-deception, accumulates other beliefs, with the
completely unintended and accidental result of becoming a trivialist. I suspect that
Priest has only envisaged a scenario in which an agent comes to live her life already
being a trivialist. But of course, it is possible that someone’s trivialism occurs quite
accidentally as the end result of a life involving similar paths of belief and desire
formation as exhibited in the story of Bret and Jenny. Note also that it is highly unlikely
that such a situation would obtain. But its possibility is enough to undermine Priest’s
argument, which seeks to show that it is impossible for the trivialist to act with purpose.
Moreover, that such a scenario is improbable fits excellently with the empirical evidence
that trivialism is very rare among humans. I conclude then that it is intelligible to think
120
that a trivialist could believe that s obtains and yet intend to bring s about (although I
admit that this is highly unlikely).
With respect to the second of these possible responses (that there is a suitable substitute
for belief and desire that will explain an act of a trivialist), I wish to make the following
suggestion. We can make sense of such an act to bring s about if it is the case that the
agent in question believes that she desires or intends to bring s about, and it is the case
that she believes that s does not obtain. So long as these conditions obtain, then even if
the agent believes that s obtains, it is quite intelligible to say that the agent can act to
bring s about. The key idea here is that the agent believes that she intends or desires to
bring s about – whether or not it is actually true that she desires or intends this.
The assumption being made here is that it is not a necessary condition for acting to bring
s about that one intend or desire to bring s about. Rather, the necessary condition is the
disjunction ‘either an agent intends or desires to bring s about or the agent believes she
intends or desires to bring s about’. In other words, the belief that one intends or desires
to bring about s plays the role that an actual desire or intent would have played (if it had
been present) in making such an act intelligible. That the trivialist really believes that she
desires to do this (even if it is not really true that she does), is sufficient to make the act
intelligible. Of course, this amounts to a modification of the orthodox theory that we
explain action by citing relevant desires and beliefs. The modification amounts to the
idea that we can explain an act purely in terms of an agent’s beliefs – provided that they
are the right kinds of beliefs, i.e. beliefs about one’s own desires and intentions. I take
121
this to be a rather minor modification to the orthodox position and one that is not
without its intuitiveness. But given that this is so, we can see immediately that the
trivialist can act with purpose. The trivialist has all beliefs, and so a fortiori, she has the
belief that she intends or desires to bring about some situation s. Moreover, she believes
that s does not obtain (even if she believes that it does obtain as well). So it is quite
intelligible to say that she can act to bring s about. The trivialist can, it seems, act with a
purpose even if she has none of the relevant intentions.161
In summary it can be seen that there are available two responses to Priest’s argument.
The first is to show that it is intelligible to think that a trivialist could intend and desire
to bring about any given situation even though she believes that these already obtain.
The second assumes that Priest is correct in thinking that the trivialist could have no
intentions and attempts to provide a substitute that can explain the acts of the trivialist.
Both of these responses have at least some plausibility to them. I conclude that Priest’s
argument against the possibility of belief in trivialism is, arguably, unsound.
6. Response 2: Need the Trivialist Believe Everything Entailed by Trivialism?
Now, those philosophers who have actually bothered to explore trivialism with any
seriousness usually characterize the trivialist as explicitly committing her to everything

161 Of course, it might be objected at this point that because the trivialist believes she desires and
intends each and every desire and intention, she would be unable to act in a discriminatory
manner. In response I direct the reader to the conclusions reached in section 3 where I point out
that the habits of the trivialist can be accounted for in terms of factors that are not accessible to
the trivialist, such as reflexes and deep neurological structures - just as some of the habits of any
human might be accounted for. The solution I propose here is only designed to answer Priest’s
objection and not that of Aristotle.
122
that is implied by the claim ‘everything is true’. In other words, in addition to believing
the claim ‘everything is true’ the trivialist also believes each and every individual claim
about reality. Some examples include ‘it is raining’, ‘Australia is a republic’, ‘humans
have three heads’, and so on. In addition, the trivialist, according to this account,
believes the negation of each of these claims. It is this account of what it takes to be a
trivialist that is thought to be incompatible with the nature of human action and choice.
And indeed, this is the definition of trivialist that I have taken for granted throughout
the thesis up to this point. The above two arguments from Aristotle and Priest both hold
to the claim that believing each and every sentence to be true is sufficient to qualify as a
trivialist. In my view there is nothing wrong with defining the notion of trivialist in this
manner. But I believe that there are philosophically interesting notions of what it is to be
a trivialist that do not require that the trivialist believe each and every proposition – and
so notions of what it is to be a trivialist that avoid the difficulties cited by Aristotle and
Priest. Even if trivialism entails every proposition, it is not clear to me that the beliefs of
the trivialist need be closed under this entailment (and, indeed, nor should they be).
With this in mind, I wish to explore in this section of the thesis a different notion of what
it is to be a trivialist to the one I have so far stipulated.
To see this, consider the following. In general, to be meaningfully characterized as an
Xist one need not believe each and every claim entailed by X. For example, to be a theist
one is expected to believe that there exists an omnipotent, omniscient, and
omnibenevolent being, who is also the creator of the world. However, one is not
expected to believe everything entailed by such a claim. For example, it is not normally
expected of a theist that among his beliefs is the explicit belief that my pet Chihuahua,
123
Basil, is sustained in existence through the powers of an omnipotent being. This is
despite the fact that this is clearly entailed by the existence of an omnipotent,
omniscient, and omnibenevolent being, and who is the creator of the world (combined,
of course, with the fact that Basil exists). Of course, once a theist has heard about the
existence of Basil, it is appropriate, even mandatory, for the theist to then have as an
explicit belief that Basil is kept in existence by God. Indeed, the theist will explicitly
believe many of the implications of the existence of the theistic deity, and indeed would
be required to. If a person only believed in the existence of a theistic deity but nothing
that is entailed by this, then it would not be appropriate, perhaps not even meaningful,
to refer to them as a theist. This would simply be because part of what it means to hold a
belief is to see the implications of this belief for ones other beliefs. Beliefs necessarily
form part of a larger network.
Now I think that this straightforwardly applies to the trivialist. Although the trivialist is
required to be committed to the claim ‘everything is true’ along with many of the claims
entailed by this, she need not believe every claim entailed by ‘everything is true’. And
this would be for reasons similar to why we would not expect the theist to explicitly
believe every claim entailed by the existence of the God of theism. For example, just as a
theist may not have given consideration to Basil and his status as a creation of God
(perhaps because she did not know that Basil existed, for example), the trivialist may not
have given any consideration to a whole host of things. For example, it is certainly true
that ‘everything is true’ entails ‘Basil exists’ but the trivialist may have no opinion at all
as to what Basil is, whether there is even a proposition ‘Basil exists’ or what not – it has
never crossed her mind. Of course, having given it consideration (perhaps as a result of
124
having personally met Basil) it would be expected that she then form the belief ‘Basil
exists’ and also believe this on the basis that it is implied by ‘everything is true’. In other
words, it would be required to add this to her belief network – to see the connections
between her various beliefs.
So, if it is not necessary for a trivialist to believe everything that is entailed by
‘everything is true’ in order to be a trivialist, what exactly is required? To see what
might be required consider the following. If you came across a person, who believed in
the truths of the Catholic faith, and they believed many things entailed by these truths,
and they did not believe anything incompatible with Catholicism, then this person
would rightly be described as a Catholic. That they do not believe everything implied by
the truths of the Catholic faith is not relevant. But the same would seem to apply to the
trivialist. If they believed the truth of the sentence ‘everything is true’, and they believed
many things that were entailed by this, and they did not believe anything incompatible
with this sentence, then this person is a trivialist. That they do not believe everything
entailed by the definition of trivialism is neither here nor there.
But it follows that one does not have to believe each and every sentence in order for one
to believe in trivialism. So, one can believe in trivialism and act in a discriminating
manner i.e. they choose one option over another in order to fulfill some purpose. They
can choose to eat bread over glass because bread is more nutritious. Their believing that
the bread is more nutritious than the glass does not rule out their being trivialist, as this
claim is entailed by trivialism.
125
Likewise, a trivialist can form a purpose and act on that purpose. They might believe
that they require nutrition and so eat bread in order to achieve that nutrition. For this to
be possible all they need to believe is that their being nourished fails to be true. And, of
course, believing that it fails to be true that they are nourished is entailed by trivialism.
So, their believing that they are unnourished (without also being nourished) does not
rule out their being trivialist.
But because trivialism entails anything at all, it is impossible for someone to have beliefs
that are incompatible with trivialism. So long as a person believes the truth of the
sentence ‘every sentence is true’, then they can believe literally anything else (and
indeed nothing else) and qualify as a trivialist. Indeed, they can believe that reality is
nontrivial and qualify as a trivialist, as the non-triviality of the world is entailed by
trivialism. Such a person is a genuine trivialist. There is nothing that the nontrivialist can
point to in the beliefs of such a person that entitle the nontrivialist to say, ‘ah ha! I knew
you were not a trivialist, because you believe X’. The nontrivialist would only be entitled
to do this if there were an X that is incompatible with trivialism or maybe not implied by
trivialism, but there is no such X. Indeed, for every X it is entailed by trivialism and it is
compatible with trivialism. The trivialist cannot believe something that is not implied or
compatible with her belief in trivialism.
We can conclude then that at most the arguments from Aristotle and Priest show us that
one cannot be a trivialist in the sense that one believes each and every proposition, i.e.
there is not a person j, a proposition p, and a relation B (‘believes that’) such that ∀p jBp.
But they do not demonstrate that one cannot be a trivialist in another meaningful and
126
straightforward sense, i.e. there can be a person j such that jB(∀pTp). It should be
emphasized here that I am not saying that Priest and Aristotle have made a mistake in
understanding a trivialist to be a person who believes each and every proposition. After
all, the meaning of ‘trivialist’ is a matter of stipulation and not a matter of fact. My only
point is that the notion of a trivialist offered in this section is as philosophically
interesting as the one offered by Priest and Aristotle and yet it avoids the problems they
have cited.
Now it might be thought in reply to this response that there is something irrational
about not believing each and every sentence entailed by trivialism given that one is a
trivialist. But this retort presupposes that the trivialist already believes certain things
about the nature of rationality, inference, and truth. For example, as Priest points out,
the trivialist would have to accept “… universal instantiation, the T-schema, [and] modus
ponens.”162 It might be, for example, that the trivialist holds certain epistemic criterion
(such as ‘only believe what you can see’) to have higher epistemic status than these three
principles. As such, she will not allow her beliefs to be closed under entailment in this
manner. Indeed, she might reject anything that makes her believe in things that are not
accessible to her in the part of triviality that she perceives. Clearly not everything is true
for her. As such, she will refrain from believing everything.163

162 Priest, Doubt Truth to be a Liar, 65n.
163 I will examine the sense in which someone might not have perceptual access to the entirety of
a reality that is deeply contradictory in the next chapter.
127
But, in addition, it would seem that the very arguments of Priest and Aristotle
(assuming that they are sound) provide the trivialist with sufficient reason not to believe
each and every proposition. That is to say, both arguments would render the trivialists
refusal to believe each and every proposition quite rational. In reply then to the claim
that her avoiding belief in all propositions is irrational, she can simply say that she is
justified in doing this because if she did not, then it would be impossible for her to
behave in a discriminating and purposeful manner. Destruction of the acting self is
hardly rational given many worldviews (there are, of course, exceptions - Hinduism and
Buddhism, for example). For such a worldview, a rational agent avoids anything that
would result in her existence being compromised, including believing things that
prevent her from existing (something that would be deeply compromised if an agent
were to believe each and every proposition to be true). The trivialist justifies the
limitedness of her beliefs in terms of her desire to continue existing as a rational agent.

It would appear then that not only is it possible to believe in trivialism but it is a
relatively easy belief to take on. All that one presumably requires is good reason for
thinking that it is true. Once one has found such reason and has taken to believing the
sentence ‘everything is true’, one need not make any further revisions to ones belief
system. Everything that one already believes is not only compatible with this sentence
but it is entailed by it. Trivialism then is the least controversial and simplest
metaphysical theory ever devised. In a sense, everyone is already a trivialist waiting to
happen. All that is required is a little incentive in the right direction – perhaps in the
form of an argument for trivialism (for which there are plenty as I have discussed in
chapters 2 and 3).
128
7. Response 3: Have Priest and Aristotle Misunderstood the Nature of Belief?164
A third possible response is available to the trivialist: Might it be that Aristotle and
Priest misunderstand the nature of belief? It would appear that the arguments of both
philosophers make specific assumptions about the nature of belief. To see that this is so,
consider the following.
Let’s begin with Aristotle’s position. According to this, the trivialist cannot choose to eat
bread over glass for the reason that bread is better for her, as she believes that bread and
glass are equally good for one another. But note that this assumes that there is nothing
more to a belief than its propositional content. If it were the case that belief was
characterized by some additional quality (to its propositional content) that could vary in
degree, then this conclusion does not necessarily follow. For instance, the trivialist
believes that bread is very nutritious and she also believes that glass is equally
nutritious, but the latter belief might not possess this additional quality to the same
degree as the former. As such, she is compelled to act (assuming that this extra quality
determines behavior) on the former as opposed to the latter.
Likewise for Priest’s argument: the claim is that the trivialist cannot act to bring it about
that she is going for a walk, as she already believes that she is going for a walk. But
again, might it not be the case that her belief that she is already going on a walk be
characterized as failing to have to the same degree this extra quality as her belief that she

164 This response was first suggested to me by Mark Ressler of the University of Melbourne,
Australia.
129
is not going for a walk? As such, it is the former that is the basis for her purposeful act of
gong for a walk, rather than the latter.
That belief may differ according to more than just its content is suggested in the
reflections of David Hume. In his A Treatise of Human Nature Hume puts the question:
“Werein consists the difference betwixt incredulity and belief?”165 Hume argues that the
difference cannot consist simply in content, as an imagining has the same content as a
belief. For example, I can entertain the possibility of God’s existence without actually
believing that he does exist. But this thought does not differ in content to the thought
that expresses my belief that there is a God. As such, the difference must consist in a
quality other than content:
I conclude, by an induction that seems to me very evident, that an opinion or
belief is nothing but an idea, that is different from a fiction, not in the nature, or
the order of its parts, but in the manner of its being conceiv’d.166
And for Hume this manner is largely an affection or feeling of the mind that can differ in
“… force, or vivacity, or solidity, or firmness, or steadiness.”167 It is this higher degree of
feeling that explains why beliefs determine our behavior whilst imaginings do not.
But if this is correct, then this account of belief will help us to answer the arguments of
Aristotle and Priest. Now I wish to extend Hume’s account of belief and postulate that
such feeling or affection can come in degrees, i.e. it is possible for different beliefs to
differ from each other in the degree of the manner of its being conceived. So, it is not

165 Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, 143.
166 Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, 146.
167 Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, 146.
130
only that belief can differ from imaginings in this manner, but also that beliefs can differ
from one another in this manner. People believe things more or less – belief in
something is not then an all or nothing affair.
Although I do not wish to defend Hume’s particular account in this thesis and my
extension of it, it would seem that it is very much in line both with common sense and
the modern philosophical idea that a belief is a propositional attitude. It would seem to
be not implausible that there is more to a belief than its propositional content. There is,
in addition, the attitude that a mind has toward that content. And it is not at all difficult
to believe that this attitude can differ in its strength or degree or magnitude. What this
attitude consists in I would not like to say, and indeed I agree with Hume that it is
probably basic and that it cannot be analyzed into anything more basic:
I confess, that ‘tis impossible to explain perfectly this feeling or manner of
conception. We may make use of words, that express something near it. But its
true and proper name is belief, which is a term which everyone sufficiently
understands in common life.168
But if this is at all a plausible account of belief, then it would seem that the conclusions
of Aristotle and Priest do not obviously follow. To show that belief in trivialism is
incompatible with discriminating and purposeful behavior, they would need to show
that there is no differentiation in manner or attitude across the beliefs of the trivialist.
But given that it seems natural that a human being would have beliefs that differ in this
dimension, it seems implausible to think that the trivialist would be any different in this
regard.

168 Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, 146.
131
8. Concluding Remarks
So much then for the arguments presented by Aristotle and Priest that it is impossible to
believe in trivialism. The arguments make an important assumption that belief is an all
or nothing affair. As I have shown (in section 7), there is reason to believe that this
assumption is questionable. There are available accounts of belief that allow for degrees
of belief. But even if we grant this assumption, it would seem that we can stipulate
philosophically interesting notions of what it is to be a trivialist that avoid a trivialist
believing each and every proposition (section 6). And finally, it seems that there is
reason for thinking that even given the account of belief assumed by Aristotle and Priest,
and given their preferred notion of what it is to be a trivialist, the trivialist can act in a
discriminating and purposeful manner (sections 3 and 5). I conclude then that it has not
been shown that the denial of trivialism is justified because trivialism is unbelievable.
There is, of course, an obvious alternative way that one could respond to the two
arguments from Priest and Aristotle. One could agree that they are sound but respond
with a resounding ‘so what?’ Perhaps trivialism is impossible to believe, and so one
could never be a trivialist. But one could still think that it is possible that trivialism be
true. Indeed, one could even think that there are good reasons for thinking that it is true
and indeed that its denial is impossible. It is just that one could not take the final step
and believe that everything is actually true. The trivialist can respond then to these
arguments by taking on a similar attitude to the one of David Hume toward his own
skepticism. Whilst in his study he is a skeptic, but once he leaves the confines of his
study he has to go about living much in the same way as everyone else – as someone
132
who is not a skeptic. But Hume was still convinced within the confines of his study that
he was right about our beliefs and the epistemic status of these.

Now one might think that trivialism is a rather useless view philosophically speaking if
it is not possible to believe that it is true. But this response betrays a narrowly and
culturally defined notion of the aims of philosophy. In some philosophical traditions (I
have in mind here Buddhism and Hinduism, among others) the aim of philosophy is not
so much to justify certain beliefs, but rather to bring about a state of salvation or
liberation. Indeed, in traditions such as Buddhism and certain forms of Hinduism, the
state of liberation is one that involves the dissolution of the self, and this fits comfortably
with the conclusions reached by Priest and Aristotle. Perhaps the aim of the trivialist
should be the dissolution of the self. On this account of what it is to be a trivialist, the
trivialist would accept that trivialism is an undeniable truth about reality. She would
believe, at the very least, the proposition, ∀pTp. But she would recognize, along with
Priest and Aristotle, that true unity with the triviality of reality involves dissolution of
the self (in the sense of an agent that can act). The religious impulse is, at least in part,
characterized by a desire to become one with ultimate reality in some sense, and so she
aims to extinguish herself and become one with a trivial reality by believing everything,
and thus making it impossible to act - and thus impossible to live as an agent. Certainly,
if trivialism is true, this might be construed as the ultimate aim in life, much in the same
way that the dissolution of the self is considered the ultimate aim in life given the truths
of Buddhism or Advaita Vedanta. I will have more to say about the existential prospects
of trivialism in the conclusion of the thesis.
133
But even in the narrow academic environment of western philosophy, trivialism might
still have philosophical value – as I have already suggested in the introduction of the
thesis. Despite the best of efforts in showing that one cannot be a trivialist, there is still
the shocking possibility that trivialism could very well be true. One could imagine that
there will come a time when introductory philosophy courses at various universities are
conducted not around the topic of skepticism, but around the topic of trivialism – it is an
interesting possibility that no one could actually believe, but it is so difficult to refute
that it is a useful way of sharpening the philosophical skills of a student, as well as
testing the worth of a philosophical theory.
To conclude it must be emphasized that even if the arguments from Priest and Aristotle
were sound and trivialism is unbelievable (and so there is no such thing as a trivialist)
this would not solve the problems for those who seek to deny trivialism. As I argued in
chapter 3, nontrivialism is unbelievable and so there is no such thing as the nontrivialist.
As such, the one should not overestimate the victory of those who argue for the
unbelievability of trivialism, even assuming that their arguments are sound.
134
Chapter 5: Is it Possible to Observe a Contradictory State of Affairs?169
1. The Argument
In his paper “Perceiving Contradictions” Priest argues that the observable world is
consistent:
Consider the observable world, i.e. all that is observably the case. If there were
inconsistencies in this, it would follow … that we would perceive them. But apart
from the odd visual illusion, we do not: our perceptions of the world are entirely
consistent. Hence, the observable world is consistent.170
I will refer to this as the argument from perception. Priest has interpreted his argument
from perception as an a posteriori argument against trivialism.171 But as discussed in
chapter 3, one can immediately dismiss an argument of this sort by pointing out that
even if it is sound, all it shows is that trivialism cannot be true. But so what? This in no
way amounts to the performance of the denial of trivialism, as nothing amounts to a
denial of trivialism. All that such an argument does is map out some of the content of
trivialism, among which is that our perceptions are largely consistent and that not
everything is true of the observable world. As an argument for rejecting trivialism it
fails. But as an expression of the denial that the observable world is contradictory, the
argument is quite meaningful. But even in this dialectical context I believe that the
argument fails, and I will articulate these reasons in due course.

135
In this chapter I will give two reasons for thinking that this argument is unsound given
this dialectical context: First, that Priest has failed to show us what a contradictory state
of affairs would look like, such that we know that we are not seeing such things; and
secondly, there are good reasons for thinking that a contradictory state of affairs would
appear consistent – reasons that are intrinsic to the nature of a contradictory state of
affairs. Ironically, although my analysis of Priest’s argument will show it to be unsound,
it will also imply that there can be no observable or empirical evidence for trivialism or
for the extreme form of dialetheism argued for in the final chapter of the thesis.
Dialetheism will remain a philosophical/metaphysical thesis that will never have direct
contact with empirical science.172
That the observable world appears to be consistent is obviously true. When we look
around us we see that things appear consistent. The desk in front of me appears to be in
the location that it is and nowhere else – it does not appear both at that location and not
at that location. The colors of the wall appear white and white only – the wall does not
appear both white and black for instance. Likewise, the coffee cup on the desk appears
to be at rest, period – it does not appear to be both at rest and in motion. And, to raise an
example that will feature in the final chapter of the thesis, we observe bodies in motion
to be making progress in a certain direction and not also regressing in that direction. No

172 This may not be a view shared by other dialetheists. Priest (Doubt Truth to be a Liar, 162-4)
seems to think that it is possible that future science may make observations that are best
explained by being caused by contradictory physical states of affairs. The analysis I present here
casts some doubt on that. Although I should add that the example that Priest provides does not
involve inferring a contradictory state of affairs from the fact that the content of a perception was
contradictory. As such, it is not clear that the conclusions drawn in this chapter apply to the point
Priest is illustrating.
136
matter where we look the world appears to be straightforwardly consistent. The
question is whether this appearance of consistency is good reason for thinking that the
observable world is consistent.
Priest thinks so and the reason he gives is that if it were otherwise, if it were
contradictory, then it would appear to be contradictory i.e. we would have contradictory
perceptions. But what is it for something to appear to be contradictory? Priest provides
an answer to this question as well. He gives three examples of contradictory perceptions
i.e. perceptions the contents of which are contradictory: a Penrose Figure, the ‘waterfall’
effect, and a specific example of a ‘fill in’ effect.
Priest describes the Penrose Figure (figure 1) as follows:
If one takes a corner, say the nearest one, one can see that, traveling continuously
counter-clockwise, one can ascend to arrive back at the same place. The point,
then, is higher than itself (but obviously, it is not higher than itself, as well).
Moreover, one can take the whole figure in … all in one go. This is a case where
we can see a contradictory situation.173
For an example of this see http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PenroseStairway.html
Fig. 1

173 Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions,” 440-1.
137
The lesson that Priest draws from the Penrose Figure is that it is ‘… quite possible to
perceive a contradictory situation’174. Given the Penrose Figure we know what it is like
to see something that is both higher than itself and not higher than itself.
The second example of a contradictory perception provided by Priest is the so-called
‘water-fall’ effect.175 This effect arises in a number of contexts and can be generated
when a continuous motion of some sort conditions the visual field. When the viewer
then looks at a stationary scene this appears to move in the opposite direction to the
original motion. Despite this, any one point in the visual field does not change its
position. Priest refers to the commonly experienced ‘spinning room’ effect that a person
perceives when they lay down on a bed whilst intoxicated: the room appears to spin and
yet no point in the room is changing position. Another version involves figure 2
below.176
For an example of this see http://www.youramazingbrain.org/supersenses/disc.htm
Fig. 2
By shifting the figure back and forth, the concentric circles of rhombi are seen to rotate in
opposite directions despite the fact that each rhombus remains in the same position on
the page. In such perceptual experiences the image is both in motion and not in motion.
The lesson Priest draws from this is once again that it is possible to perceive a

174 Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions,” 442.
175 Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions,” 441-2.
176 This particular example is not used by Priest but it illustrates the effect well enough.
138
contradictory situation, specifically the contradictory situation of seeing something that
is both moving and not moving.
The third example used by Priest involves a type of ‘fill in’ effect.177 In certain
experiments involving a visual field that is half red and half green with a black line
down the middle, when the black line is removed the brain is forced to fill in the
resulting gap. Some subjects report seeing the boundary being colored both red and
green. Priest also reports a similar experience with the use of 3-D glasses. Upon putting
on such glasses he reports seeing the scene, before vision settles, to be colored both red
and green, although at different depths of the visual field. Again Priest draws the
conclusion that it is possible to perceive a contradictory situation, specifically the
contradictory perception of a visual field being both red all over and not red all over.
So, for Priest, such examples “…show that we may have perceptual experiences the
contents of which are contradictory”178. From this we are entitled to infer that because
we do not have such experiences outside of these rare examples, that the observable
world is not contradictory. In other words, the observable world is consistent.
2. Various Objections

177 Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions,” 442.
178 Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions,” 443.
139
There have been various objections made to the argument from perception, some being
more successful than others. Priest himself raises the following point:
Might it not be the case, though, that our cognitive functioning makes it
impossible to see certain conjoined states of affairs? Specifically, it might be
suggested that our perceptual mechanisms impose a ‘consistency filter’ on what
we see.179
According to this Kantian style argument, the human mind is structured such that it has
the power to impose a consistent order upon an otherwise contradictory world. As such
we should expect the observable world to appear consistent even if it were not. But as
Priest points our there is no independent evidence that we have such ‘consistency filters’
and indeed from the fact that we can cite examples of contradictory perceptions, there is
good reason to think that we do not have them.180
Other criticisms of the argument have more plausibility, however. For example, Doris
Olin has pointed out that Priest is not entitled to claim that we know what it is to have
contradictory perceptions, as at most he has shown that we know what it is for only
some perceptions to be contradictory.181 Indeed, Priest gives only three examples of
contradictory perceptions. Olin also gives reason for doubting that we know what it is to
perceive a particular contradictory state of affairs on the basis that we know what it is to
have a particular contradictory perception. According to Olin this assumes that

179 Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions,” 444.
180 Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions,” 444.
181 Olin, Paradox, 31. Priest responds to this in Doubt Truth to be a Liar, 63. He basically denies the
premise of Olin’s objection: “But we do know what contradictions look like.” What is Priest’s
basis for this claim? Simply, the examples of illusions he provides.
140
There is only one way that a thing can appear to be both, say, at rest and in
motion: the way his example illustrates. The fact that things do not look that way
is the reason I can supposedly see that the cup is not both at rest and in motion,
But perhaps there is another way, one that I do not know, that things might look
if this particular contradiction were true. Clearly, the argument does not
establish that for any observable α, α&~α can be perceived not to obtain.182
J.C. Beall also points out that at most Priest has shown that we could observe
contradictory states of affairs and not that we would.
183 To drive home this point Beall
entertains the idea that a contradiction might appear exactly like one of its conjuncts
does. This can certainly be the case for consistent conjunctions (Beall gives the example
of ‘Greg is at the piano and there is an opaque shield surrounding the piano’), so why
not for contradictions? That being so, many of our observations of contradictions might
involve straightforwardly consistent perceptions.
In addition, one might also add that it is not clear that Priest has provided us with
examples of perceptions with contradictory contents. It is possible to re-describe all the
examples in question such that the contents are consistent and yet the strangeness of the
perceptual experience is preserved. The Penrose figure can be understood as being a
staircase in a space that is non-Euclidean (there is only a contradiction in ascending and
returning to the same point if the space is Euclidean).184

182 Olin, Paradox, 31.
183 Beall, “Is the Observable World Consistent,” 114. Priest responds to this in Doubt Truth to be a
Liar, 63n15: “I am not sure I see the force of this objection. Would if what? If it can be seen then
we will see it if we look in the right direction, have our eyes open, etc.”
184 I must confess that I do not know if there could be any sort of space in which it is possible to
ascend and end up at the same point. It would depend I imagine on how one can construe the
notions of ‘ascending’ and ‘descending’. The space that has the closest resemblance to this kind of
141
Likewise, the ‘water-fall’ effect can be understood as a figure or body being in motion
and not being in motion in two different senses – not being in motion in the sense that
they do not change position and being in motion in the sense that our sensory apparatus
are disoriented. Also, it is not clear in this particular example that there has been a
perception of the points on the moving body remaining stationary. It seems to me that
they appear to be moving, period, when we shift the page back and forth. The claim that
they are also stationary is inferred from our memory of what the rhombi do when we
keep the page at a constant distant.
Similarly the ‘fill in’ effect can be understood not as being both green and red but as
being an entirely new color altogether. Now whether any of these re-descriptions are
more plausible than those offered by Priest is a point worth debating. I think that there is
a good case for the first (assuming that there is such a space and that there are relevant
notions of ascending and descending in such a space) and third, a less plausible case for
the second.
Finally, one might wish to add that Priest’s argument misses the strongest reason for
thinking that the observable world is consistent, namely that it is a priori impossible for
contradictions to obtain. This is, of course, the kind of reason that would be given by a
classical logician or an Aristotelian, or anyone who holds the Law of Non-Contradiction

thing that I can think of is a spherical space (which possibly describes the structure of our
universe).
142
to be an a priori truth. Of course, this line of argument is not at all convincing for a
dialetheist. But regardless of the outcome of the debate between the monoletheist
(monoletheism being the view that all propositions have at most one truth value) and
the dialetheist, it remains the case that Priest’s argument is really just an a posteriori
version of this line of reasoning, and as such it is one that is just as acceptable to the
Aristotelian or the classical logician as it is to the dialetheist (and the trivialist for that
matter). Priest’s argument then has a sort of apologetic superiority to the a priori version
in that it does not beg important logical and philosophical questions.
3. Contradictory Perceptions as Non-Veridical: The Case of Escher’s Belvedere
The examples of contradictory perceptions provided by Priest are illusions, or to put it
in more technical language, they are non-veridical. What this means is that although
these figures and experiences appear to be contradictory, this is no reason for thinking
that they actually are. Priest does not think that this matters for the argument from
perception:
Of course, the examples are not veridical; they are illusions: but they fulfill the
required function none the less. They show that we may have perceptual
experiences the contents of which are contradictory.
185
In this section I will assume that the examples that Priest has provided of contradictory
perceptions are indeed contradictory. But even if we do grant this much, the argument
from perception can be doubted on other grounds. The argument from perception relies
on the claim that if we are having contradictory perceptions, then we are entitled to

185 Priest, “Perceiving Contradictions,” 443.
143
conclude that we are having perceptions of contradictions. The assumption here is that
an observable state of affairs that is contradictory would give rise to a perception the
contents of which are contradictory. The question is whether we are entitled to conclude
that this is true on the basis that we have contradictory perceptions. I believe that we are
not so entitled, and the reason revolves around the fact that all the examples of
contradictory perceptions we have are illusory. So, the fact that when we look around
and see that we do not have perceptions of the sort discussed by Priest is not sufficient
reason for us to conclude that there are no observable contradictions – it is not clear that
observable contradictions would appear contradictory.
The admission that the examples at hand are illusory or non-veridical is an admission
that the contradictory perceptual experiences are caused by consistent states of affairs. In
other words, these examples show us what certain consistent states of affairs would look
like, not what certain contradictory states of affairs would look like. What Priest has
shown is that particular consistent states of affairs appear to be contradictory. He has
shed no light on what a contradictory state of affairs would look like, which is what he
would need to do in order for the argument from perception to work.
The key to seeing that this is the case centers on the fact that we often know why the
examples in question are non-veridical or illusory.186 We know that the fact that these

186 That we know they are illusory is because we can see they are not compatible with what others
perceive. Nor are they compatible with the information supplied by our other senses (Priest,
“Perceiving Contradictions,” 444-5).
144
appear contradictory is no reason for thinking that the states of affairs in question
actually are contradictory because we know the real reason for why they appear the way
they do – and it is not because they are contradictory. To illustrate what I mean here I
will make use of the example of Escher’s famous lithograph, Belvedere (figure 3).
For an example of this see http://www.mescher.com/. Follow the prompts to the
section ‘1955-1972’.
Fig. 3
I use this example for two reasons. First, Escher cites this as an example of a
contradictory perception. Secondly he provides expert commentary (he is after all a
superb artist) on the reason why it appears this way. It is worth quoting Esher’s
commentary on this piece in full:
In the lower left foreground there lies a piece of paper on which the edges of a
cube are drawn. Two small circles mark the places where edges cross each other.
Which edge comes at the front and which at the back? In a three dimensional
world simultaneous front and back is an impossibility and so cannot be
illustrated. Yet it is quite possible to draw an object which displays a different
reality when looked at from above and from below. The lad sitting on the bench
has got just such a cube-like absurdity in his hands. He gazes thoughtfully at this
incomprehensible object and seems oblivious to the fact that the belvedere
behind has been built in the same impossible style. On the floor of the lower
platform, that is to say indoors, stands a ladder which two people are busy
climbing. But as soon as they arrive a floor higher they are back in the open air
and have to re-enter the building. Is it any wonder that nobody in the company
can be bothered about the fate of the prisoner in the dungeon who sticks his head
through the bars and bemoans his fate?187

187 Escher, Escher, 15.
145
According to Esher the contradictory state of affairs depicted in the scene is that of the
parts of the building structure (and the cube-like absurdity) being simultaneously
located at the front and the back of the structure. In addition, the characters in the scene
are perceptually aware of the contradiction. The boy on the seat ‘gazes thoughtfully’ at
the paradoxical cube in his hands. The folk using the ladder find themselves beginning
their climb on the inside of the building but finishing it on the outside. All of them are so
distracted by the perceptual experience of this contradictory arrangement that they are
unaware of the plight of the poor prisoner.
Although the perceptual experience of the picture is supposedly contradictory, Esher
makes it clear that in actual fact there is nothing in the lithograph that is contradictory.
Indeed, there are elements in the lithograph that function to show us how the
paradoxical nature of the belvedere and the cube-like structure is generated. This is the
function of the cube drawn on the piece of paper in front of the boy. On the diagram the
points of intersection of the sides are marked with a circle. The curious thing about the
sides is that there is no clear answer as to which of them is supposed to come at the back
and which at the front. The cube can be consistently interpreted in two different ways
each corresponding to a different front-back arrangement for the sides. Now the reason
why the sides cannot be interpreted unambiguously in this manner is because this is a
figure on a two-dimensional surface. In other words there is no front and back that can
determine unambiguously which of the interpretations is correct. As such, the brain has
no visual cue to determine which interpretation is correct and so jumps between the two
interpretations. This is exactly what happens for the cube-like structure and the
146
belvedere itself. These are actually two-dimensional structures and so there is no front
and back to unambiguously determine which of the sides or pillars is at the front and
which is at the back. The brain is left to jump between the two interpretations. Either
way we have a perfectly consistent state of affairs that is the cause of the inconsistent
perception.
In order to judge if the observable world is consistent we need to find out what an actual
contradiction looks like. It is not relevant what some consistent state of affairs looks like.
It is not relevant what the belvedere in the lithograph looks like to us. The relevant issue
is what the belvedere looks like to the characters in the lithograph. After all, they are
supposed to be in a three-dimensional world in which the sides of cubes and the pillars
of the belvedere are simultaneously front and back. We can say for sure that it will look
nothing like it looks to us observing the lithograph as we do. How it looks to us is what
a consistent state of affairs looks like. So, an actual structure that has sides that are
simultaneously at the front and back will not look like that.
The same for the examples used by Priest. We are not interested in what it is to see
illusory examples of such contradictory perceptions, as that is what consistent states of
affairs look like. We want to know what it would be like to actually live in a world
where the stairs are simultaneously higher and not higher than themselves. We want to
know what it is to live in a world where things both are and are not in motion. We want
to know what it is like to live in a world in which there are things that are both red and
green.
147
So, all the cases of contradictory perceptions are actually caused by consistent states of
affairs. In other words, we really only know what certain bizarre consistent states of
affairs look like – they appear contradictory. So, we are not entitled to conclude from
these examples that an observable state of affairs that is contradictory would give rise to
a perception that is contradictory. One is not entitled to think, on the basis of the
examples given, that the conditional ‘If the world is contradictory, it appears
contradictory’ is true. Now one may reply to this in the following way: It is certainly
true that things are not always as they appear, i.e. reasoning on the basis of appearance
is defeasible; however, unless we have positive reasons to the contrary, it is quite
reasonable to infer the reality from the fact that things appear that way; and as such we
are entitled to believe that if the world were contradictory, it would appear
contradictory – as there are no reasons to think that a contradiction would not appear
contradictory.
In the next section I will give reasons for thinking that a contradictory state of affairs
would not appear contradictory. But that aside for now, I do not think that we are
entitled in this instance to the principle that things are as they appear. In my view it is
not enough that there is an absence of positive reasons to the contrary. Whenever we use
this epistemic rule in everyday life we do so against a background of at least some
positive reasons in support of this claim. For example, if we see a shimmering body of
water out in the distance, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a shimmering body of
water out in the distance in the absence of reasons to the contrary. But this is only
148
reasonable because we have at least some cases in which we have seen actual bodies of
water, and these appear as shimmering when seen from a distance. But in the case at
hand, we have no actual contradictions that we know the appearance of. All we have are
illusory contradictions. We would not be entitled to conclude that the appearance of a
shimmering body of water is a body of water if all we had were the experiences of
mirages.
4. The Inconsistent Observer
What then does an observable contradiction look like? In this section I will show that an
observable contradiction will appear consistent. As such, the fact that the observable
world appears consistent is no evidence that it is actually consistent. The world may
very well be replete with observable contradictions and we would be none the wiser if
we were relying solely on observation. I will show that this is the case in two steps. First,
I will give a possible explanation for why we might perceive a contradictory state of
affairs as consistent. Secondly, I will perform a series of thought experiments that will
show why this account must be so. That is to say, I will show that it is impossible to
have a contradictory perceptual experience that is due to an observable contradiction.188
All observable contradictions result in consistent perceptual experiences.

188 There might be some confusion about my use of the term ‘observable’ in this context. When I
refer to an observable contradiction I mean that the contradiction describes things that would
otherwise be observable, i.e. macro-sized objects. That is to say, other things being equal we
would observe such a thing. But, of course, the point of my argument in this chapter is that other
things are not equal.
149
Why might it be the case that observable contradictions look consistent? How might it
be possible for the observable world to be deeply inconsistent and yet appear
straightforwardly consistent? To see how this might be so I want to introduce a couple
of analogies that will help illustrate the idea. Think for a moment how someone who is
cross-eyed might nonetheless see the world as if it were in clear focus. One way to
achieve this is to provide this person with a pair of lenses that then corrects the
incoming light rays so that the image itself takes on a cross-eyed appearance. But to this
person it will look to be in perfect focus.
Another way to ensure that a cross-eyed person will see the world as if it were in perfect
focus would be to change the physical properties of the world itself such that the world
actually exists in a cross-eyed state i.e. the world naturally appears as out of focus to
someone with normal eye sight. Such a person would see a perfectly focused world.
Now we can change the story around a little to make it more applicable to our purposes.
If the physics of the world were such that naturally the world appeared as out of focus,
then this out of focused state would be unobservable, in the sense that it appeared
focused, if all observers had their visionary apparatus in a cross-eyed state.
Now for the second analogy. According to quantum mechanics, physical states can exist
in a superposition. David Lewis, in his succinct exposition of the concept of
superposition, illustrates the idea using the example of a Benzene molecule.189 Such a
molecule can exist in a state that can be described as being a halfway state between

189 Lewis, “How Many Lives Has Schrodinger’s Cat?” 3-22.
150
having one arrangement of parts and an alternative arrangement of these parts. Lewis
describes the superposition state as follows:
The molecule reacts sometimes as if it had one structure, sometimes as if it had
the other. Yet we do not think that a population of molecules is a mixture of the
two structures. Neither do we think that each molecule oscillates rapidly
between one structure and the other. Neither do we think that each molecule has
a betwixt-and-between structure – there is no such thing as a bond midway
between double and single. Rather, we think that each molecule is in a
superposition: a state objectively indeterminate between the two structures.190
Lewis suggests that we “[p]icture the molecule as a double image, as if we drew the two
structures on two transparencies and laid them one over the other”.191 A superposition is
made up of branches, where each branch corresponds to one of the indeterminate states
of the superposition. States of superposition evolve over time. Indeed, they become
entangled with other physical states that interact with them, even states that are of a
macro-observable scale. For example, if there is a device that attempts to measure the
structure of a benzene molecule that is in a state of superposition, the device itself will
go into a state of superposition one branch of which corresponds to a measurement of
one branch of the benzene superposition and another branch corresponding to a
measurement of the other branch.192 Any other physical entity that interacts with this
measuring device will also go into a corresponding state of superposition.

190 Lewis, “How Many Lives Has Schrodinger’s Cat?” 4.
191 Lewis, “How Many Lives Has Schrodinger’s Cat?” 5.
192 Although it is important to add here that according to some versions of the orthodox or
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the measuring device does not go into a
superposition. Rather, the device causes the superposition of the molecule to ‘collapse’ and
transform into one of the branches.
151
Why don’t we observe these states of superposition?193 According to one interpretation
of quantum mechanics, known as the ‘Many-Worlds’ interpretation or the ‘non-collapse’
hypothesis, it is because the observer also goes into a state of superposition as a result of
interacting with the superposition of, say, the device measuring the benzene
superposition. Each branch of the superposition of the observer has the observer
observing one branch of the device measuring one branch of the benzene superposition.
Because the observer is in a state of superposition, the states of superposition cannot in
turn be observed. This in turn is because there is no branch that corresponds to the
observer observing both branches.
Now to the task at hand. I want to suggest that the reason why we might perceive a
contradiction as consistent is because we too are in a contradictory state, just as the
cross-eyed person observes an outer focused world as focused and an observer in state
of superposition observes only a state that is not in superposition. Take for example a
staircase in which any given step is both higher than itself and not higher than itself. A
possible reason why I observe this as consistent is because I am in a state of
contradiction. Specifically the contradiction is that I observe the stair as being at a
specific height and I do not observe the stair as being at that height (perhaps, for
example, because I observe it at another height). In each of the conjuncts there is a
consistent observation of a consistent state of affairs. However, there is not a conjunct in
which I am observing both of these. Similarly for a state of affairs in which something

193 Again this question only makes sense if you reject those interpretations of quantum mechanics
in which there is a collapse of the superposition prior to observation e.g. some versions of the
Copenhagen interpretation.
152
both is moving and not moving. A possible reason why I might observe this as
consistent is because I too am in a contradictory state of observing body x in motion and
not observing body x in motion. Whilst there is a conjunct for each of the consistent
alternative observations there is no conjunct in which I am observing both. Again the
same considerations apply to a state of affairs in which something is both red and green.
A possible explanation for why I observe this as consistent is because I too am in a
contradictory state: I am observing body x as red and I am not observing body x as red
(perhaps, for example, because I am observing it as green). Again whilst there is a
conjunct for each of these consistent alternative observations there is no conjunct in
which I observe both.
Now these are possible explanations for why I observe a contradictory state of affairs as
being consistent. But is there any reason for thinking that this explanation is actually
true? Is there any reason for thinking that in the event that I observe a contradictory
state of affairs that I will be in a contradictory state thus rendering the contents of my
perception consistent? Indeed there is. In fact I think that there is good reason for
thinking that a contradictory state of affairs can only be perceived as consistent.
To see how this is so, think for a moment about what it is for any consistent state of
affairs to be perceived. Take a concrete example: a particular body in a particular place -
the pen on my desk, for instance. This is a straightforwardly consistent state of affairs.
To perceive it is to be in a causal relationship with this state of affairs. The pen on the
desk causes some effect in me the observer, or more accurately a series and cluster of
153
effects, such as photons colliding with my eye, electrical transmissions through my
nervous system to the brain, and so on. All this results in my having a perceptual
experience with a specific content – I actually see my pen on the desk. The perception of
the state of affairs in question causes certain changes in me. Perception is not a detached
affair. Rather, it results in the observer being effected in some way or another.
But these considerations apply equally to the negation of any state of affairs – in the case
at hand, my pen not being on the desk. This also is a straightforwardly consistent state
of affairs. Moreover, to perceive this state of affairs is to be in a complex causal
relationship with the absence of my pen on the desk. This results in my seeing that my
pen is not on the desk. As an observer I am effected in an intimate manner by the state of
affairs in question.
Now a contradictory state of affairs is merely the conjunction of two or more contrary,
but consistent in themselves, states of affairs – some state of affairs and a negation of
this. What applies to the contraries singularly, applies to them in conjunction. Just as a
state of affairs reaches out and causes change in the observer, and so does the contrary
of this state of affairs, in isolation, so too does this happen when these are conjoined. In
other words, each of these reaches out to effect the corresponding changes in the
observer. Except that in such a case the changes in the observer will be contradictory and
this in turn implies the observer will be in a contradictory state. But the conjuncts of the
contradictory state of the observer will each be consistent. The reason basically comes
down to this: when we have instances in which contradictory states of affairs are
154
perceived, the observer too is put into contradictory states such that the perceptual
contents of each state is consistent.
Take the example at hand. What happens when I observe the contradictory state of
affairs of my pen being on the desk and my pen not being on the desk? Well, because my
pen is on the desk the usual causal chain that takes place to result in me seeing the pen
on the desk will occur. Likewise, because the pen is not on the desk the usual causal
chain that takes place to result in me seeing that the pen is not on the desk will also
occur. In other words, I will both see the pen on the desk and I will not see the pen on
the desk. In other words, I too will be in a state of contradiction, the conjuncts of which
will consist of me seeing the pen on the desk and me not seeing the pen on the desk. But
each of these entails me seeing only one of these states of affairs. There is no conjunct of
me seeing both the pen on the desk and not the pen on the desk. There is only a conjunct
of me seeing the pen on the desk and another conjunct of me not seeing the pen on the
desk. In other words, I only ever see a consistent state of affairs despite the fact that it is
actually a contradictory state of affairs. The principle at work here is something like this:
a contradictory state of affairs is merely the conjunction of two consistent states of
affairs.194

194 Of course, it is possible for a state of affairs to have contradictory conjuncts: for example,
(A&¬A)&(B&¬B). My point is that these can be resolved down to constituents that are
themselves consistent.
155
That the observer falls into a contradictory state when the percepts are contradictory,
with the observer having consistent perceptions, is supported by our experiences of
change and modality. Change involves the transition from some state of affairs to its
contradictory. This is a fundamental aspect of our temporal experience. At some point in
time I perceive the pen on the desk and at a later time I see that the pen is not on the
desk. In general, at time tn, α is the case and at a later time tn+k, ¬α is the case. When we
perceive α at tn the perception is in a specific state p. When we perceive ¬α at tn+k the
perception is in some other state that is ¬p. What we see is that when the state of affairs
is contradictory the observer goes into contradictory states. The result of this is that the
observer only ever has perceptions with consistent contents.
Our experience of modality also furnishes us with reasons for thinking that the
perception of a contradictory state of affairs results in the observer being contradictory
which in turn results in there being perceptions with consistent contents. When we
perceive some state of affairs, say the pen on the desk, we know that it is possible that
the pen not be on the desk. We also seem to know how this possibility would make a
difference to the world at large if it were so. Indeed, we know that it will make a
difference to the observer itself and that this will be different from our perception of the
state of affairs of the pen being on the desk. That it is possible for it to be some other way
implies that in contrary circumstances it is some other way – the observer is in some
contrary state. Yet in each of these contradictory circumstances the actual contents of the
perception are consistent.
156
Before raising an important objection to the above analysis I wish to raise a more minor
point about how to correctly describe the state in which the observer finds itself
according to the account I have presented. I have chosen to say that the observer is in a
contradictory state. But might it not be more appropriate to say that the perception of
the contradiction actually results in the duplication of the observer (i.e. the splitting of
the observer into two different observers)? The issue at stake here is how observers
should be individuated. Now I am inclined to think that the resulting product of
perceiving a contradiction is a single observer in a contradictory state. However, even if
it were the case that the product of perceiving a contradiction is the duplication of the
observer this will not undermine my position. This is because it will still be the case that
each of these resulting observers will only perceive a consistent state of affairs (each
corresponding to a perception of one of the conjuncts of the contradiction) despite the
fact that the perception is of a contradictory state of affairs. In other words, the
contradictory will still look consistent.
5. Do the Conjuncts of a Contradiction Act Independently?
Now I wish to raise an important objection to the argument in the above section. In this
analysis I assume that the conjuncts of the contradiction act independently of one
another on the observer. As such, the observer only ever sees what he would if he were
looking at a straight forwardly consistent state of affairs, much like what happens when
experiencing change and modality. But might it not be the case that the conjuncts of a
contradiction interact with one another and combine forces, so to speak, and give a
unified causal impact on the observer. The observer would thereby not be forced into a
157
contradictory state and would see something quite distinct compared to a
straightforwardly consistent state of affairs. For example, if observing a section of a
staircase that is both higher than itself and not higher than itself, the conjuncts of the
contradictory state of affairs interact and produce in the observer a perception that has
the contents of the Penrose figure – quite distinct compared to the perception of a
staircase that behaves consistently. Or if one were observing a body that is both in
motion and not in motion, the conjuncts of the contradiction interact to produce in the
observer the visionary experience of the ‘waterfall’ effect.195 Again this is recognizably
different from a perception of a body that is either moving or not moving. As such we
would be able to recognize an inconsistent state of affairs. In other words, the fact that
contradictory percepts cause the observer to be in contradictory states across time and
possible worlds is not a conclusive reason for thinking that they will do so when they
relate to one another as an explicit contradiction.
It might be thought at this point that there are positive reasons for thinking that indeed
the conjuncts of a contradiction do not act independently but instead interact with one
another. After all if they can interact with the observer, then why can they not interact
with one another? What is required here is a reason that explains why the conjuncts of a
contradiction cannot interact with each other, that at the same time explains why the
conjuncts can interact with the observer.

195 Although for both such visual experiences the having of them does not imply that a
contradiction is being observed as they can, as was argued in the previous section, be generated
by consistent states of affairs.
158
It is tempting here to refer to the behavior of a range of common conjunctions as positive
reason for thinking that conjuncts do interact with each other. An example that has been
raised in the literature is the state of affairs: “Greg is at the piano and there is an opaque
shield surrounding the piano”.196 It is clear in this example that the conjuncts interact
with one another in such a manner that they issue forth in a unified causal impact on the
observer. In this case the unified impact looks exactly like one of the conjuncts –
specifically ‘there is an opaque shield surrounding the piano’. So, from this example
(indeed many examples of this sort) we can see that the conjuncts interact to provide a
unified impact on the observer that does not result in a contradictory observer. The
question is whether conjunctions of this sort are good reason for believing that
contradictions behave in a similar manner.
I think that there are reasons for thinking that such conjuncts will not show this. First, it
is clear that such cases end up producing a perception with consistent contents anyway
(as with the case of Greg at the piano surrounded by an opaque wall). As such they will
not do for the purposes of Priest’s argument from perception. The argument from
perception requires examples where a contradiction produces a perception the contents
of which are contradictory. Secondly, cases of this sort are consistent states of affairs and
so there is no reason to think that the lessons we can draw from these will apply to
conjunctions that are contradictory. After all, presumably the reason for why the
conjuncts of a contradiction fail to interact is because they are contradictory and not
because the state of affairs can be correctly expressed as a conjunction.

196 Beall, “Is the Observable World Consistent,” 115.
159
But more importantly I think that there are positive reasons for thinking that the
conjuncts of a contradictory state of affairs will not interact, but rather will act on the
surrounding world in a manner that is independent, just as they would if taken on their
own outside of a contradiction. There are at least two reasons why situations or things
may fail to interact with one another. First, they may fail to interact because they are too
isolated from one another in the sense of being too far away or there being a too great a
distance between them, in some sense. This is the reason behind why contradictory
states of affairs that are at different points in time or space may fail to interact. But
another reason why they may fail to interact is because they are too close to one another.
In other words they miss each other because they are ‘right under each other’s nose’, or
‘too close to home’, so to speak (for example, we tend to lack perceptual experiences of
our own eyes). It is this latter reason that I will show is the explanation for why the
conjuncts of a contradiction do not interact with one another. In this regard I think that it
is easy to be mislead by the formalism in which contradictions are expressed. To see this
it is useful to compare contradictions with other sorts of states of affairs that can be
expressed as a conjunction. The two sorts of states of affairs I have in mind here are
those that can be expressed as the conjunctions α∧β and α∧α.
Let’s begin with a comparison with the former of these types. Contradictions are
expressed most often in the form of a conjunction: α∧¬α. It is easy for this formalism to
generate the picture of a contradiction being a unity of two distinct parts. This sort of
state of affairs can be expressed as α∧β. It seems that for many conjunctive states of
160
affairs this is the correct way to characterize them. Indeed, for the example at hand
(Greg is at the piano and an opaque shield surrounds the piano) this is how the state of
affairs is structured. In such a situation we have a unity that has distinct parts. Moreover
it is the fact that they are distinct parts that enables them to interact, affect one another,
and then act in a unified manner upon the observer. The notion of causal interaction
presupposes two distinct entities between which the interaction can take place.
But it is this kind of distinction that is not the case for that particular type of conjunction
known as the contradiction. To be guided by the superficial appearance of the formalism
in this case is to be led astray. To understand a contradiction to be anything like a
unified structure with distinct parts is incorrect. The fact is that the conjunction α∧¬α is
just not like the conjunction α∧β. What then is a contradiction like? I suggest that it is
more accurately compared to conjunctions of the form α∧α. In other words,
contradictions are more like single whole entities. Indeed, they are single whole entities
– albeit inconsistent entities. Just as it is nonsense to ask how the conjuncts of the
conjunction ‘the pen is on the desk and the pen is on the desk’ interact it is nonsense to
ask how the conjuncts of the conjunction ‘the pen is on the desk and it is not the case
that the pen is on the desk’ interact. The conjuncts of the former are not distinct entities
that can interact. There is not the metaphysical space between them – they are the same
in every respect - one and the same entity. Likewise for the latter – the conjuncts are not
two distinct entities. Rather, they are one and the same entity. There is not the
metaphysical space between them to interact - they are one and the same in every
respect. The difference between the two types of conjunction is often expressed in saying
161
that α∧α involves an identity whilst α∧¬α involves a contradiction. However, I do not
think that it is misleading to say that they both involve an identity, although the latter
case is a contradictory identity.
It is this fact that was understood by the two great metaphysicians of contradiction,
namely Aristotle and Hegel. Despite the fact that these two philosophers disagreed
about whether the world did or indeed could contain contradictions, they both agreed
on the nature of such an entity. Take Aristotle’s classic statement of the impossibility of
contradictions:
… this … principle is the most secure of all principles … ‘It is impossible for the
same thing at the same time both to be-in and not to be-in the same thing in the
same respect’.197
The importance of this formulation of the law of non-contradiction is that it suggests
that for a contradiction there is no room for separating out the conjuncts. In all aspects
they come together. They are of the same space, same time, and the same respect. They
are not distinct parts of a larger unified whole in any relevant sense. Hegel also insists
on such an understanding of contradiction. Take his famous formulation of becoming as
the contradictory state of being and nothingness:
Both are the same, becoming, and although they differ so in direction they
interpenetrate and paralyse each other. The one is ceasing-to-be: being passes
over into nothing, but nothing is equally the opposite of itself, transition into
being, coming-to-be. This coming-to-be is the other direction: nothing passes
over into being, but being equally sublates itself and is rather transition into
nothing, is ceasing-to-be. They are not reciprocally sublated – the one does not

197 Aristotle, Metaphysics, 88.
162
sublate the other externally – but each sublates itself in itself and is in its own self
the opposite of itself.198
For Hegel becoming is not a unified structure with the parts of being and nothing. Being
does not interact with nothing to bring it about that it is being, and vice versa (i.e. they
do not sublate externally). Rather, it is being in as much as it is nothing and nothing in as
much as it is being (i.e. the sublation is internal to the conjunct). Their distinction is the
result of their identity and vice versa. Being is nothing and nothing is being. They are
the same in all respects and by being the same in all respects they are distinct. Although
it is sometimes useful to picture a contradiction as two parts of a unified whole (as Lewis
suggests we picture superposition – two transparencies laid one on top of the other), this
is strictly incorrect. To say that the pen is on the desk and that the pen is not on the desk
is to say that in as much as the pen is on the desk it is not on the desk. It fails to be on the
desk in virtue of being on the desk and vice versa. There is no separation metaphysically
speaking between the conjuncts. But that being the case one wonders what basis there
could be for the conjuncts to causally interact in the relevant sense. They do not seem to
be two distinct entities in the required sense. One is the other already, so to speak.199
So, we have before us then a reason that explains both why the conjuncts of a
contradiction cannot interact with one another and why the conjuncts can interact with

198 Hegel, The Science of Logic, 106. Hegel’s use of the word Aufehbung (here translated using the
word ‘sublate’) further highlights the point being made here. Hegel intends the word to mean
that the thing that sublates is simultaneously canceling, raising, and preserving – these being one
and the same act of sublation.
199 Clearly I am rejecting the idea that something can be self-causing. I think that this idea is
metaphysical absurd. Whereas I can make sense of the idea of a necessary being, i.e. a being that
exists necessarily, I cannot make sense of a being that is self-causing. I hold that it is part of the
meaning of causation that the two entities interacting are distinct from one another.
163
the observer. They cannot interact with each other because they are one and the same
entity and so are not distinct entities in the relevant sense. The conjunction that describes
the contradictory state of affairs is more like α∧α. As such there is no sense in which
they can interact – interaction of the relevant sort presupposes two distinct entities. They
can interact with the observer because there is here the requisite distinction between the
entities involved. The conjunction that describes the conjunct of the contradiction and
the state of the observer is of the form α∧β.
As such, the conjuncts of the contradiction act in a way that is analogous to the way in
which they would act if they occurred at different times or in alternate possible worlds.
In other words, they act independently of each other – as if the other were not present.
And of course we know how contradictories do behave from our experiences of change
and modality. They act to cause the observer to go into states that are contradictory such
that each of these states of the observer perceives a consistent state of affairs each of
which corresponds to one of these contradictories.
Now it might be thought at this point that understanding contradictory states of affairs
to be single whole entities in this manner will raise a difficulty for my solution to the
problem of perception. Consider this: surely I have made it inexplicable as to why a
contradictory state of affairs cannot enter into the single consciousness of an observer
and be registered as contradictory state of affairs as opposed to a consistent state of
affairs. If a contradiction is a single whole entity, then why is this not possible? The
answer to this question lies in realizing that perception of the contradictory state of
164
affairs does enter into the single consciousness of the observer. It is just that the observer
is in a contradictory state as well, and so, the single whole consciousness of the observer
is also in a contradictory state of being conscious of a contradiction and not being
conscious of this. The consciousness is a single whole entity but like the state of affairs
being perceived, it is contradictory too.
Now one might wish to press this objection as follows: how is it that a unified state of
affairs produces a disunified state of perception? My reply: why describe the state of
perception as disunified? Presumably it is described this way because it is contradictory.
But I see no reason to describe a contradictory state of affairs as being disunified.
Indeed, my point throughout this section of the chapter has been that it is its unity that
makes the state of affairs contradictory. There is no breaking up of the consciousness of
the observer into parts. Rather, the consciousness of the observer is rendered
contradictory. There is an important distinction to be made between disunity and
inconsistency.
Let us conclude this section by applying the above analysis to the specific examples cited
by Priest and depicted by Escher.200 The above analysis shows that an observable
contradiction will always appear consistent – that the perceptual contents of an
observation of a contradiction will be identical to the perceptual contents of an

200 I have argued above in section 3 that as a matter of fact the examples cited by Priest are
illusory and so not actual contradictory states of affairs. My point below is that on the condition
that they were contradictory (contrary to the facts), then this is how we should think of them.
165
observation of one of the conjuncts. This follows from the fact that contradictions are
infectious. They entangle with everything they interact with by passing on their
contradictory nature. To observe a staircase with each stair being both higher than itself
and not higher than itself results in the observer going into a contradictory state which
in each conjunct the observer sees a consistent state of affairs: one with the observer
seeing a given stair at a given height; the other with the observer seeing that stair at a
different height. The same applies to the other examples cited by Priest: for an object
moving and not moving there is the contradictory state of affairs of an observer seeing
the object moving and the observer not seeing the object moving; for an object that is
both red and green there is the contradictory state of affairs of the observer seeing the
object red and the observer seeing the object green. But each of the conjuncts in which a
perception is taking place is perfectly consistent.
All this shows us that the commentary Esher has made on his lithograph, Belvedere, is
incorrect. He has misinterpreted his own piece of art. Whatever the reason for the
distracted and puzzled demeanor of the characters in the lithograph it is not because of
the contradictory nature of their world. What they would see is perfectly consistent and
no different than if there were no contradictions in their world. Perhaps the boy is just
very interested in cubes and so the prisoner makes no impression on him (which would
make him a somewhat insensitive lad). Perhaps the man on the ladder is taken in by the
great scenery and this is what distracts him from the prisoner. Perhaps the people in this
world are indifferent to the plight of those who suffer – who knows?
166
We may conclude then that the argument from perception is unsound. One is not
entitled to conclude that the world is consistent on the basis that it appears consistent.
This is for similar reasons why we are not entitled to conclude that the biological world
has been designed on the basis that it appears designed: just as there are alternative
explanations as to why an organism might appear to be designed other than the fact that
it is (natural selection, for example), there are alternative explanations to why the world
appears to be consistent other than the fact that it is consistent, specifically that it is
inconsistent. As such, we have further reason for thinking that there is no good reason
for rejecting the claim that reality is trivial in addition to the insights gained in chapter 3.
167
Chapter 6: Zeno’s Arrow Paradox and the Contradictory Nature of the World
1. Introduction
This chapter has two purposes. First, this chapter is a continuation of the previous
chapter. In the previous chapter I argued that appearance of consistency does not entitle
us to conclude that the observable world is consistent, as a contradictory state of affairs
will appear consistent. In this chapter I give positive reasons for actually believing that
the empirical world at an observable scale is in fact contradictory. Secondly, the
argument presented in this chapter can perhaps be interpreted as contributing to the
case for trivialism. The argument itself falls far short of trivialism – at most it
demonstrates that every physical state of affairs is contradictory, and so it represents a
defense of what might be termed near trivialism or physical trivialism.201 But given that
trivialism entails many things that we are surprised about (such as the proposition that
every physical state of affairs is contradictory), having independent reason for the truth
of such things obviously contributes to the case for the general plausibility of trivialism.
I begin the argument by outlining a recent dialetheic analysis of Zeno’s Paradox of the
Arrow. I show that this needs to be extended in order for it to overcome further

201 There are other arguments that one can construct defending a sort of ‘near or physical
trivialism’ (as opposed to trivialism proper). Graham Priest suggests using the Sorites Paradox in
this way (Doubt Truth to be a Liar, 67). Given how prolific vague predicates are, one can use this
paradox to provide further independent evidence for the truth of a great many of the assertions
of the trivialist. For example, one could argue that an elephant is a chair in the following way.
Take any elephant. If I take a single molecule of the elephant and replace it with a single molecule
from a chair, then it is still an elephant. Do this sufficiently many times and we have a chair
(observation will confirm this). But given the validity of modus ponens and the fact that
sufficiently small changes do not transform an elephant into a chair (both plausible assumptions),
the chair must also be an elephant.
168
difficulties. In particular, I show that this dialetheic solution to the Arrow Paradox
generates its own version of the Arrow Paradox. I argue that the only way to avoid this
new version of the Arrow Paradox involves postulating that motion is deeply
contradictory. How contradictory? Well for a body moving from point A to point B, the
body is located at every point in the interval at every instant of the journey. This
obviously sounds ridiculous, but I will show that it follows neatly from some seemingly
plausible premises.

2. The Orthodox Account of Motion
In his In Contradiction Priest begins his dialetheic analysis of motion by raising some
problems for what he refers to as the orthodox account of motion. The orthodox account
of motion is simply this: “motion consists merely in the occupation of different places at
different times.”202 Stated most clearly by Bertrand Russell, Priest refers to this as the
orthodox account of motion, not because it is found to be absolutely uncontroversial and
free of any conceptual difficulties, but because it is considered the received view. Priest
quotes Russell in order to clarify the orthodox account, and it is worth repeating here:
Motion consists in the fact that, by the occupation of a place at a time, a
correlation is established between places and times; when different times,
throughout any period however short, are correlated with different places, there
is motion; when different times throughout some period however short, are all
correlated with the same place, there is rest. 203

202 Priest, In Contradiction, 173. Italics are Priest’s. Priest also presents an analysis of motion in
Priest, “Inconsistencies in Motion,” 339-46.
203 Priest, In Contradiction, 173.
169
Priest sums this up nicely when he states “… for something to be in motion at an instant
is simply that it is found at different places at arbitrarily close instants.”204
3. Zeno’s Paradox of the Arrow
Priest raises a couple of objections to the orthodox account of motion. The first is that the
orthodox account of motion entails that there is no instantaneous state of motion. Rather,
motion is a relational phenomenon between the positions of a body at different instants
of time. On the orthodox account there is no difference between a body at rest at some
instant and a body in motion at some instant – they are both located at a single position.
I will not examine Priest’s discussion of this problem here, mainly because I believe that
his solution is more than adequate given the assumption that contradictions are
possible.205 The second objection Priest raises to the orthodox account of motion, what I
refer to as the problem of progression, is derived from one of Zeno’s paradoxes of
motion, specifically the arrow paradox.206 Priest invites the reader to imagine the point
of an arrow that is in motion from point x to point y. At any instant, say t0, the arrow
does not advance at all on its journey from x to y. It is at one point in space and one
point only. The progress made at this instant in time is zero. But the temporal interval of
the journey between x and y is just made up of the aggregate of such instants. Since no
progress can be made at any instant of the journey, it seems that no progress can be
made over the whole temporal interval from x to y. Priest puts it nicely when he asks

204 Priest, In Contradiction, 173.
205 For a critique of this aspect of Priest’s dialetheic analysis of motion and change see Littmann,
“A Critique of Dialetheism,” 59-100.
206 Priest, In Contradiction, 174-5.
170
“How can a going somewhere be composed of an aggregate of going nowheres?”207 It
would appear that it cannot, and so the orthodox account of motion seems inadequate.
There must be more to motion than just being at different places at different times.
Now for some initial objections. To begin with, there are many who do not find Russell’s
orthodox account of motion at all unintuitive. That motion is merely the occupation of
different places at different times is felt by such a person to be intuitively acceptable.
This account, of course, denies that there is such a thing as an instantaneous state of
motion. Motion is merely a relational concept, i.e. a relation between points in space and
points in time. It is clear that the Paradox of the Arrow assumes that there is such a thing
as an instantaneous state of motion. Without such an assumption the paradox could not
get off the ground. The problem is generated because we note that a body is not making
any progress at an instant. The obvious response to this is to say that the reason why it is
not making progress at that instant is because it is not moving at that instant. But this is
not to say that it is stationary at this instant. At that instant it is neither moving nor not
moving, and this is because motion is not defined at an instant but across intervals of
time. For a supporter of the orthodox account, the motion is to be found across time and
not at a single instant. Unless someone finds the notion that an instantaneous state of
motion is required to render a theory of motion intuitive, it is clear that the arguments
proposed by Priest and myself will have no force at all. I take it as an assumption that
there is such a thing as an instantaneous state of motion, and that the task of the
philosopher is to analyze what this is.

207 Priest, In Contradiction, 175.
171
It might also be thought that the kind of objection expressed by the Arrow Paradox
involves an instance of the fallacy of composition – the fallacy that a whole has to have
the same properties as its parts. As such, this retort to Priest’s analysis would go
something as follows. Just because the parts (i.e. instants) that make up the temporal
interval have the property of the particle in motion not making progress, it does not
follow that the whole interval (i.e. the aggregate of the instants or the interval) also has
this property.
It is undoubtedly true that reasoning that the whole interval has the property of noprogression, because the individual instants that make it up have this property, fails to
be a deductively valid inference. However, this is not how Priest is reasoning. All he is
saying is that it is inexplicable how progress could be made over the entire interval when
no progress is made at any of its parts. This is certainly not a knockdown argument, but
it does undermine the orthodox account of motion to the extent that it is unable to
account for how a moving body can be in different places at different times.
With regards to solving the problem of progression Priest warns against turning to
mathematical analysis.208 It is tempting with regard to this objection to refer to
contemporary understanding of the length of a set of points in terms of a measure
function. It is no doubt true that a finite number or even a countably infinite number of

208 Priest, In Contradiction, 175.
172
points on the real line will give a measure function of zero, while if the points form an
interval on the continuum, say [x,y], then the measure function will be equal to y-x. That
one can prove this mathematically does not remove the philosophical perplexity
generated by the problem. The question remains: How is this possible? The mathematics
only shows that it is possible – not how it is possible. It does not illuminate the
mechanism behind this.
Now there are some obvious responses of a methodological nature to this point that
really need to be mentioned – although I do not intend to answer them in any definitive
sense in this thesis. Take, for example, a thinker such as Adolf Grünbaum.209 I suspect
that Grünbaum would consider this question (i.e. the question, ‘How is progress
possible given that all there is to motion is being in one place at one time?’) to be a kind
of pseudo-question that is generated by false presuppositions. This is a common strategy
of Grünbaum’s in his analyses of various philosophical issues raised by scientific
theories. As an example of a pseudo question he gives the following: ‘When did you
stop beating your wife?’210 Under some circumstances this is quite a sensible question,
but when it is asked of a man who has never beaten his wife, it is a pseudo-question, as
it is based on an assumption that does not apply in the circumstances (specifically, that
there was a time when he did beat his wife). Another example is an issue raised by
Descartes in his Meditation III (and indeed more recently by thinkers such as

209 See Grünbaum, Modern Science and Zeno’s Paradoxes, 133. See also Grünbaum, Philosophical
Problems of Space and Time.
210 Grünbaum, “The Pseudo-Problem of Creation in Physical Cosmology,” 102.
173
Swinburne211) with regard to the persistence of material objects through time.212 Theists
such as Descartes have thought that an external cause (God) is required in order to
answer the question ‘Why do physical objects not disappear into nothingness?’
Grünbaum points out that the question is a pseudo-question because it is based on the
empirically false presupposition that the natural state of things is nothingness, and so
any deviations from this state of nothingness require explanation. But, according to
Grünbaum, our most empirically well-confirmed scientific theories take matter and
energy conservation to be the natural state of things. For Grünbaum, the question of
what constitutes a natural state of affairs is a purely empirical issue and not one to be
determined by a priori means.213
Grünbaum might very well take the question of this section to be a pseudo-question for
similar reasons. Priest has generated a pseudo-problem based on the mistaken
presupposition that motion cannot be a certain way if progress on a journey is to occur.
But for Grünbaum, the properties that motion must have in order for progress to occur,
is something to be discovered by actually studying the empirical world of moving
objects. Our best account shows that these are not required – as far as we can tell, bodies
move in the way our theories describe, and there are no empirical reasons to think
otherwise.

211 Swinburne, Is there a God?, 48-55.
212 Grünbaum, “The Pseudo-Problem of Creation in Physical Cosmology,” 101-2.
213 Grünbaum, “The Poverty of Theistic Cosmology,” 586-90.
174
I am not going to settle this subtle methodological issue in this thesis, suffice to say that
if Grünbaum is right then a whole slab of traditional methods of philosophy have to be
tossed out. Grünbaum belongs to that relatively new tradition that was dubbed
‘scientific philosophy’ by Reichenbach.214 Reichenbach and Grünbaum might be right,
but for now I will side with the predominant historical tradition and assume that a priori
philosophizing is legitimate in this context.
4. Priest’s Hegelean Solution to the Paradox of the Arrow
Given the problems that the orthodox account faces, Priest considers an alternative
account that was formulated by Hegel.215 Hegel describes his account of motion as
follows:
[Motion] itself is contradiction’s immediate existence. Something moves not
because at one moment of time it is here and at another there, but because at one
and the same moment it is here and not here …216
The state of motion is a state of contradictory positions at any one instant. The reason
Hegel gives for thinking that motion is a contradictory state is that it is impossible to
localize a moving body.217 Hegel thinks that it is impossible to localize a moving body
because of the peculiar nature of the continuum. Distinct points in space and time merge
into one another. In addition, space and time are a contradictory blend of the continuous
and the discrete.218 But whatever the reason for why a moving body is in a contradictory

state, Priest argues that by hypothesizing that this is the case, one is able propose a
theory of motion that is not vulnerable to the objection just considered. In other words,
the Hegelean account of motion can explain how a body makes progress on a journey
i.e. it can explain how a moving body can be at different places at different times.
Priest proposes what he calls the ‘spread hypothesis’ to describe the Hegelean state of
motion:
A body cannot be localised to a point it is occupying at an instant of time, but
only to those points it occupies in a small neighbourhood of that time.219
Priest gives a more rigorous formulation of the spread hypothesis mainly so that he can
show how the Hegelean account of motion relates to the canonical idea that motion can
be represented by functional equations i.e. the idea that motion is a change of place with
time (x = f(t)). I will not go into this more precise formulation, as it is not crucial to the
points that I wish to argue. But the central idea of the spread hypothesis is this: A point
particle in motion at time t occupies a certain point x. But at an instant very close to t,
say t’, it occupies a point x’ (where x ≠ x’). According to the spread hypothesis it is
impossible to localize a body over very small intervals of time between, say, t and t’. The
location of the particle at time t is x, but it is equally located at time t at the position it is
in at t’. As such, the particle at t is equally at x and at x’, equally at x and somewhere else

2, Chapter 1. The way I see it, the individual points of the continuum are contradictory objects.
Specifically they have contradictory extensions. Postulating this makes sense, for example, of that
property of the continuum referred to as density. That a point has contradictory extensions
explains why there is no next point in a continuum, or that between any two points there is an
infinity of others. This is because such a point has no unique beginning or end boundary to mark
it off from the next point - they blend together, so to speak.
219 Priest, In Contradiction, 177.
176
i.e. not at x. It is important to emphasize that the spread of contradictory positions of
which Priest envisages motion to consist will be over a very small region of space and
over a very small interval of time. These regions and intervals are hypothesized by
Priest to be on the scale of Plank’s Constant (a scale of 10-43) and so it is physically
impossible to observe them.
Given the Hegelean account of motion it is now possible to see how a body can make
progress on a journey. At each instant the body does make progress. This is because at
each instant it occupies a spread of points – it both is at a particular point and not at that
particular point i.e. it is at another point. Now if it makes progress at a single instant, it
makes progress during the aggregate of instants. It is important to make it clear here
that Priest is not denying that motion involves being in different places at different
times. That motion involves this is patently obvious. All he is saying is that this is not
sufficient in order for motion to occur, that something more is required. Priest is
providing an explanation for how a moving body can be in different places at different
times. For Priest, you achieve different places at different times by being at different
places at the same time.
And so the Hegelean account of motion, at least for Priest, has distinct advantages over
the orthodox account.220 It would seem that this analysis can be applied to other forms of

220 Of course, it would be quite acceptable to take an agnostic position here and conclude that
motion is ultimately mysterious. That a person finds the orthodox account of motion
unacceptable, and for the reasons given by Priest, does not imply that they should accept the
177
change besides motion, which themselves are of a continuous nature. Changes of this
sort seem to require the existence of contradictory states of affairs.221
5. A New Version of the Paradox of the Arrow
For the rest of this chapter I will assume that the critique Priest offers of the orthodox
account of motion is sound and that he is correct in claiming that in order to solve the
problem of progression one is required to hypothesize, along with Hegel, that the state
of motion is a contradictory one. However, it is not clear to me that Priest can avoid
isolating the contradictions inherent in motion to unobservable levels on the scale of
Plank’s Constant. Too see why this is so, it is important to realize that that Priest’s
version of the Hegelean account of motion suffers from its own problems. Indeed, it
seems that this problem can be understood as an alternative interpretation of the Arrow
Paradox of Zeno.
To see this consider the following. Priest draws an inference from,
(A) Advance is made at an instant,
to

Hegelean account. If a person were committed to the law of non-contradiction (i.e. that
contradictions are false), then the Hegelean account would be at least as unacceptable as the
orthodox account. It must be understood however that the success of the Hegelean account of
motion in solving the problem of progression is part of the cumulative case for dialetheism. There
are also alternative accounts of motion on offer. One example is Tooley, “In Defence of the
Existence of States of Motion,” 225-54. According to Tooley a state of motion is an instantaneous
theoretical (i.e. unobservable) property of a moving object. Priest, rejects Tooley’s account, among
other reasons, because it fails to solve the arrow paradox – i.e. it cannot explain how a body
makes progress at an instant (see Priest, In contradiction, 297).
221 Priest also provides a dialetheic account of temporal change – see In Contradiction, 213-20.
178
(B) Advance is made at the aggregate of instants.
Even if (A) is true given the spread hypothesis, I do not think that this entails (B). It is
possible to reformulate the problem of progression so that it affects the Hegelean
account of motion defended by Priest. To see why this is so consider the following. Take
again a point object, say the tip of an arrow, in motion from point x to point y. Assume
that the distance from x to y is some observable distance (and for observable objects such
as the tip of an arrow this is the normal state of affairs). According to the spread
hypothesis, at each instant this object occupies a spread of points. Moreover, this spread
is going to be much smaller (given that it is comparable to Planks constant in
magnitude) than the total distance between x and y. Indeed the entire journey from x to
y will be made up of these very small spreads of contradictory positions. At each instant,
as the point object journeys from x to y, its location is spread over a different series of
points as each instant passes. There is a series of different spreads as the point object
makes its way over the much larger distance from x to y. Now given Priest’s definition
of motion as being both at the same point and not the same point at the same time; and
given his analysis of this in terms of the spread hypothesis; and that observable
journey’s are much larger than the spreads hypothesized by Priest, observable motion
amounts to this: different spreads at different times.
Notice that this understanding of observable motion (i.e. motion is different spreads at
different times) is not relevantly different from the orthodox definition of motion (i.e.
motion is different places at different times) in the sense that it is structurally identical.
The only difference is that in the account offered by Priest, ‘places’ means spreads (i.e.
179
contradictory points), whereas by ‘places’ the orthodox account means points. Given
this, the problem with Priest’s analysis of the motion of the point object is that one can
construct a new problem with its progression that has some similarities with one
implied by the orthodox account of motion: how does the point object progress from one
spread at one instant to another spread at a later instant? After all, at each instant the point
object only occupies the points in this spread and no other points. So, at this instant it
does not make any progress on the journey. At each instant a point object is at a specific
spread of points and only at that spread of points. There is nothing more to the motion
of the point object than the contradictory spread of points. But if there is no advance at
any particular instant, how can the object be at another spread of points at a later
instant? The temporal interval of the entire journey from x to y is just the aggregate of
these instants of no progression. How can a series of no progressions add up to a
progression?
Notice that this version of the Arrow Paradox is different from the one that Priest seeks
to solve with his Hegelean account of motion and the spread hypothesis. The problem
he seeks to solve is ‘How does the point object make any progress at all’. The answer he
provides is that it makes progress simpliciter by being at different points at the same
time. The problem I am raising for Priest’s account is slightly different: ‘How does the
point object make progress from one given point/spread to another given
point/spread?’ This is a new version of the Arrow Paradox. Whether this was what
Zeno intended we will never know (perhaps he was drawing our attention to both forms
of the paradox).
180
As with the orthodox version of the problem, it is no solution to the Hegelean version to
turn to mathematics. It is tempting to say that the rules of arithmetic explain how the
aggregate of spreads add up to the whole journey. All we do is sum the length of the
spread at each instant and this will give the entire length of the journey from x to y. But
this arithmetical procedure does not so much explain how the progression occurs as it
encodes the idea of the progression occurring. The mystery still remains – how does the
progression occur?
And again, the fallacy of composition has not been committed in the above explication
of this paradox – it might be that the whole journey can occur despite its parts not being
equal to it in length. It is just that it is inexplicable how this occurs, and this
inexplicability counts against Priest’s analysis of the Hegelean account of motion.
6. The Arrow Paradox and the Ontology of Points
Before proposing a solution to the Hegelean version of the problem of progression, I
wish to reflect on the implications of this version of the arrow paradox for an obvious
solution to the original version. For those who hope to resist the move to a Hegelean
account of motion, it may be tempting to reject what is thought to be a key premise in
the arrow paradox. The crucial premise at stake is that space and time are composed of
points of zero size.
181
It is clear that as the paradox is usually formulated, it is taken for granted that space and
time are composed of points of zero size. The paradox asks us to consider the state of a
moving point object (an object of zero size) at an instant (a time point of zero size).
According to the orthodox account, this point object is at one point in space (a structure
of zero size). And of course, since the size of this point is zero, the progress made at that
instant is zero.
Now it should be emphasized that the assumption that space and time are composed of
points of zero size is hardly an arbitrary assumption. There are good reasons to think
that this is actually the case. Priest, for example, accepts the ontology of points partly
because he thinks that much of our best science appears to presuppose this in its use of
the real number line to model physical reality.222 Of course, many will dispute the use of
scientific theories to support the claim that the continuum is a real entity on the grounds
that it demands, unreasonably, that we are ontologically committed to all the items in
our theories.223 Of course, it is possible to mount a case for thinking that this is required.
However, what I wish to show now is that the arrow paradox does not rely on the
assumption that space and time are composed of points of zero size. On the contrary,
even if space and time were composed of intervals, or spatial atoms, or chronons, some
version of the arrow paradox can be generated if the orthodox account of motion is
adhered to.

222 Priest, In Contradiction, 162. Priest also accepts the ontology of points because he thinks that the
alternative, that space and time are composed of intervals, has undesirable philosophical
consequences, specifically that it seems to imply that there are no states of change.
223 William Lane Craig, for instance, argues that non-realist accounts of mathematical and
scientific theories and their use of the continuum are to be preferred given the counter-intuitive
behavior of really instantiated infinite collections – see Craig, “Graham Oppy on Infinity,” 224-7.
182
This conclusion follows directly from the analysis of the spread hypothesis above. As
shown, this hypothesis suffers from its own version of the arrow paradox. A spread, as
Priest defines it, is simply an interval of contradictory positions at any instant. As such, a
spread is not relevantly different from an interval or chronon or any other sort of nondegenerate object. And so a version of the orthodox account of motion that presupposes
that space and time are structured in such a manner will also suffer from a version of the
arrow paradox. To see this consider the following thought experiment. Take an intervalsized object that is in motion at some interval of time. According to the orthodox account
of motion (given our new assumptions this will be different spatial intervals/atoms at
different time intervals/chronons) at any one interval/chronon of time an object is at
one interval/atom of space only. And so the object makes no progress at that
interval/chronon of time – it is just where it is located and nowhere else. But then how
can the object be at other intervals/atoms of space at later intervals/chronons of time?
The entire time taken for a journey is merely the sum of all its sub-intervals. But if the
progress made at each of these is zero, then it seems that the aggregate of these nonprogressions should also be zero.
What follows from this brief analysis is that the arrow paradox is not generated because
of any assumptions made about the composition of space and time. Rather, the paradox
is intrinsic to the orthodox account of motion. What generates the paradox is that motion
is treated in a discrete or atomistic manner i.e. motion occurs one ‘unit’ of space for
183
every ‘unit’ of time. Whether these units are of zero size or not (or whether or not the
interval is a consistent collection or not) is beside the point.
7. A Solution to the New Paradox of the Arrow
That issue aside, I will now return to the version of the arrow paradox that undermines
the spread hypothesis. The obvious and simplest solution to this problem is to
hypothesize that the spread of the point object, that is its state of motion, is equal to the
interval from x to y of the entire journey. This is very much an extension of the way in
which Priest solves the problem of progression as it relates to the orthodox account of
motion: achieve progression by having the point object located at more than a single
point. But it is not enough to have the location of the object at a small spread of
contradictory positions if the journey is much larger. Rather, it must be the case that the
point object is located in a spread of contradictory points that make up the whole
journey – from beginning to end. As soon as you admit that in order for there to be
motion there has to be contradictory location, you are going to have to go all the way.
So, the point object makes progress over the journey because it is located at each point in
the journey. In the case of the tip of the arrow, it both is and is not located at each point
in the journey from x to y and that is how it gets from x to y – it both is and is not at x
and it both is and is not at y, and every point in between. The lesson here is that it is not
possible to limit the contradictory states to small unobservable intervals of space. The
contradictory states that constitute motion are over arbitrarily large intervals of space,
184
the size of which depends on the journey the object is taking. In conclusion: motion is
the contradictory spread of an object over the entirety its journey.
8. Various Objections
What are we to make of this account of motion? There are obviously some issues that
need to be addressed before we judge its plausibility. First of all, it might be thought that
I have missed the real problem with Priest’s analysis of the Hegelean account of motion
and so my own solution merely repeats this mistake: If a body in motion is at every
point either in a small interval of the journey (as Priest suggests) or of the whole journey
(as I suggest), then why think that there is any progress being made over the interval or
journey? Why is the body not regressing rather than progressing? If it is at every point
from A to B why not say it is regressing from B to A rather than progressing from A to
B?
My reply to this point is as follows: The body in motion is indeed both progressing from
A to B and regressing from B to A given the account I have proposed. But this will not
undermine this account as a solution to the problem of progression. This is because
regardless of what else such a body in motion does, it does achieve progress (even if it
regresses as well). To think that this undermines my analysis as a solution to the
problem of progression is to assume that the regression cancels out the progression. But
this is to assume what has been referred to as the cancellation account of negation and
this clearly is not the relevant notion of negation in this context given that it is being
assumed that some contradictions are true. In this context we have to assume a
185
paraconsistent notion of negation (¬p is true iff p is false) – or at least some account of
negation in which contradictions possess content. Hegel certainly rejected the
cancellation notion of negation with his concept of Aufehbung – a notion of negation in
which something is not cancelled out but raised to a new level.224 Whether one espouses
a classical, paraconsistent or relevant logic, contradictions are understood as having at
least some content (and a contradiction has total content given the validity of explosion).
But on the cancellation account a contradiction has no content at all. But contradictions
would seem to have content. To say otherwise is to imply that all contradictions have
the same content – i.e. no content at all.225 But the contradictory sentence the liar
sentence (‘this sentence is false’) would seem to have a different content to the
contradiction, ‘it is both raining and not raining’. It would seem then that there are good
reasons to reject the cancellation account of negation and so little motivation to accept
that the assertion of the negation of some sentence is equivalent to denying that
proposition.
Of course, this raises the additional problem of why it is we do not observe the body
both progressing and regressing. This problem has already been dealt with in the
previous chapter. A body that is both progressing and regressing would split the
observer into a contradictory state of observing a progression and not observing a
progression – there is a conjunct in which each of these are observed but no conjunct in

224 See Hegel, The Science of Logic, Vol. 1, Bk. 1, Sect. 1, Ch. 1, C.3. For a good account of the
different types of negation see Routley and Routley, “Negation and Contradiction.”
225 This objection is cited in Routley and Routley, “Negation and Contradiction,” 212.
186
which both are observed. So there are versions of the observer which do in fact observe
the body regressing from B to A.
A second point that can be raised in response to my specific critique of Priest’s version of
the Hegelean account of motion is this: It might be thought that the extended version of
the arrow paradox can be avoided by having the spread of an object at a particular
instant overlap with its spread at a later instant. As such, the object can make progress
over more than a single instant. The body would make progress over the whole journey
without being located at every point in the journey. This solution can perhaps be
expressed in the following diagram (fig. 4)
A B
[-------------------{-------]-------------------------------}
Fig. 4
A point particle, p, makes its way from point A to point B by occupying two spreads, S1
and S2, at t1 and t2 respectively. The spread S1 is contained within the area enclosed by [ -
- ] and the spread S2 is contained within the area enclosed by { --- }. As per Priest’s
version of the Hegelean account, p occupies each and every point in the relevant spread
at that instant. According to this solution, because the spreads overlap, p is at more than
one spread at that instant. As such it makes progress over the sum of instants. But,
according to this response, it does this without being at every point in the journey.
187
I do not think that this way of avoiding the extended version of the paradox is going to
work. The reason is as follows. Either p is located at every point in S1 and S2 at t1 or it is
only located at every point in S1 at that time. If the former of these, then this solution
reduces to my version of the Hegelean account of motion, as the point is located at every
point of the entire journey at that instant. If it is the latter of these, then the paradox has
not been avoided, as it is still at one spread and one spread only. Now one might
respond to this last claim by pointing out that p is located at more than one spread
simply in virtue of the spreads overlapping – by being at S1 it is also at S2 because these
overlap. However, it is not the case that the particle is located at S2 at that instant. Rather
the particle is located at a proper part of S2. There is still an entire section of S2 at which p
is not located at that instant. As such, given the reasons spelt out in the extended
paradox, p cannot be located in this extra part of S2 at a later instant. In order for a body
to make progress on a journey it must be at every point in the journey at every instant of
the journey.
A further concern can be raised that can be expressed as follows.226 If a particle is at all
points of motion at all times of the journey, then it is in exactly the same state at all
times. Therefore, there is no change and so no motion. In other words, this account of
motion amounts to a denial of motion.

226 This objection was raised by Priest in correspondence and is analogous to one of the reasons
why he rejects accounts of change that deny that space and time are composed of points of zero
size.
188
There are a few things that can be said in response to this concern. First, Priest’s own
version of the Hegelean account is also vulnerable to it, at least to an extent. On this
version a particle is at all points of its motion over a spread, then it is exactly the same
state over that spread, and so is not in motion over that spread. If there is no motion at
the spread, then there is no motion over the entire journey!
Secondly, it is not clear that it follows that just because a body is in the same state at all
times that there can be no change and so no motion. What is required here is for a theory
of motion to distinguish clearly between what it is for a body to be in motion and what it
is for a body to be at rest. It is not clear that this requires of a theory of motion that it
avoid understanding motion in terms of being in the same state. Indeed, to expect that it
avoid such a thing is to beg the question in favor of the orthodox account of motion, i.e.
motion is different states at different times. If the arguments developed by Priest and
rehearsed in this chapter are sound, then understanding motion in this way is somewhat
problematic. But the fact is, both my own version of the Hegelean account and that of
Priest do clearly distinguish between a body at rest and a body in motion; it’s just that
the distinction is not in terms of different states at different times. Rather, the distinction
is in terms of consistent and contradictory positions: a body in motion is in contradictory
positions and a body at rest is in consistent positions.
Finally, it seems to me that the real concern lurking behind this objection is something
like the following: how does this account of motion relate to our perceptual experiences
189
of motion? To say that a theory of motion must be able to take seriously the idea that
motion involves states of change is to think that this is essential to motion. This can only
be because we perceive that things in motion change their state of position. It would
appear that these perceptual experiences seem to be of a body at different states at
different times. Motion seems to be perceived as being constituted by changes in
position rather than being perceived as contradictory positions. It is this problem that I
will address in the next section.
9. Is this Really an Improvement for the Hegelean Theory of Motion? The
Problem of Perception
An important feature of Priest’s analysis is that he suggests that the contradictory states
hold over very small intervals – indeed intervals that are of a much smaller than
subatomic level i.e. in order of Plank’s Constant (≈ 10-43). Insisting on this has at least
two advantages as far as I can make out. First, it enables Priest to link the Hegelean
account of motion with one of the more successful physical theories currently available,
namely quantum mechanics. Priest speculates that quantum indeterminacy may be the
result of the contradictions inherent in motion and other forms of change.227 If there is
something in this speculation, then this makes the Hegelean account of motion a
foundation for quantum mechanics. Any empirical evidence in favor of the truth of

227 Priest, In Contradiction, 180.
190
quantum mechanics (and such evidence is in plentiful supply) can be construed as
evidence in favor of Priest’s version of the Hegelean account of motion.228
Secondly, and more importantly, by isolating the contradictory states to very small
unobservable scales, Priest extracts what may be seen as unintuitive elements in this
theory of motion. Many perhaps reject the idea that change is inherently contradictory
because they cannot even imagine what it would mean for this to be so. This in turn may
be because they cannot imagine what it would be to observe such a thing. So, perhaps by
taking away the possibility of observing such contradictions, the Hegelean theory is
rendered more palatable.
However, these advantages are not available to the version of the Hegelean account that
I have proposed. If these contradictory states are arbitrarily large, then it seems
implausible to say they are unobservable. Observable objects such as arrows are made
up of point objects (or at least this is what Priest would concede) and so the
contradictory spread of locations of these point parts applies to the observable object as
a whole. But this would seem to entail that observable objects are in contradictory states
when in motion and that the contradictory states should be observable. For some this
may be the ultimate reductio ad absurdum of the above analysis. Amour-Garb and Beall
probably speak for most when they state that:

228 Although this will not be much of a victory as it will equally constitute evidence for
alternative, yet consistent, interpretations of quantum mechanics.
191
Our hunch is that the difficulty in seeing how a state of affairs could both obtain
and fail to do so involves the mistake of trying to imagine observable states of
affairs both obtaining and failing to do so – e.g. the journal’s being here in front
of you and its not being here in front of you. For what it is worth, we cannot
imagine such states of affairs both obtaining and failing to obtain, either.229
In the absence of any evidence of these contradictory observations, this could undermine
the Hegelean account of motion. But given the conclusions reached in the previous
chapter, we do have an explanation for why we do not observe such contradictory states
of affairs. That we do not observe them therefore does not constitute evidence for
thinking that they do not obtain.
In conclusion: given that motion is so deeply contradictory, many physical
contradictions obtain. This is given the fact that many if not most (and even perhaps all)
physical phenomena can be reduced to motion of some sort. Here we have what might
be called a physical trivialism or a near trivialism. That we can arrive at such a radical
dialetheism with relatively straight forward claims about the nature of motion does take
the sting out of trivialism itself. Again though (to emphasize a point I made at the
beginning of the chapter) this is not going to work on any one who does not share
similar intuitions concerning the idea of a state of motion (and I think that it is safe to
say that many do not share such an intuition). But however unintuitive the notion of an
instantaneous state of motion is, it is not as unintuitive as the idea of nontrivialism
(understood as the speech act of the denial of trivialism) – a view, as I have shown in
chapter 3, which is literally unbelievable. In addition, it should be kept in mind that

229 Armour-Garb & Beall, “Further Remarks on Truth and Contradiction,” Italics are ArmourGarb and Beall’s.
192
claims that the physical world is deeply contradictory are not without precedent in
modern physical cosmology. The Big Bang model entails that the universe began as a
singularity. The singularity is characterized by physical quantities (such as density) that
have the form n/0 (because the singularity is a zero dimensional point). Given that
dialetheism is true, this would entail that certain physical quantities take on all values,
because any finite real number divided by zero results in every value being equal to
every other value. Now most I think would reject the physical reality of the singularity
because it would have such properties if it existed.
 230 Such a response, however,
assumes that dialetheism is false. Arguably, dialetheism is true. But the point I am
making here is that modern physical cosmology suggests facts about the nature of the
universe that are comparable to the claims I am arguing for in this chapter in terms of
lack of intuitiveness.


230 See for example Smith, “Kalam Cosmological,” 185; Grünbaum, “The Pseudo-Problem of
Creation in Physical Cosmology,” 113-5; Grünbaum, “Some Comments on William Craig’s
‘Creation and Big Bang Cosmology’”; and Craig, “Theism and Big Bang Cosmology,” 224-30.
However, others have no problem with the reality of the singularity but deny that it has
contradictory properties - see Smith, “Atheism, Theism, and Big Bang Cosmology,” 207-12.
193
Conclusion: Summary and Existential Implications
Summary
There we have it – trivialism is true and it is both possible and reasonable to believe that
it is true. I have reached this conclusion in the following way. First, as I argued in
chapter 3, the consensus view on trivialism – that trivialism should be denied – is not
sustainable in the sense that it is literally impossible. This is for two reasons. First,
trivialism is the conjunction of every proposition. Secondly, it is not possible to express a
denial of a conjunction by asserting one or more of its conjuncts. It follows that
nontrivialism cannot be performed or expressed – there is no such speech act. As such,
the nontrivialist does not exist and there is nothing that one can believe that would
enable one to be a nontrivialist. In the dialectic between the trivialist and the
nontrivialist, the trivialist wins by default, as there is no such thing as the nontrivialist.
But even if we assume a different account of denial that enables one to successfully deny
trivialism (one in which denial does not involve asserting something asserted by the
trivialist, as it does not involve asserting anything at all), it still remains the case that
there is nothing that one can assert that results in the performance of the speech act of
nontrivialism and so nothing that one can believe that would make one a nontrivialist.
But, as I have pointed out, there are reasons for thinking that such alternative accounts
of denial are not entirely satisfactory.
Secondly, one should assert trivialism. This is because there are available a whole host of
arguments for the truth of trivialism. These included an argument based on the Curry
194
Paradox, a modal argument from the philosophical thesis of possibilism, an argument
based upon the Characterization Principle, a cosmological style argument from the
existence of a trivial entity, and an argument for near trivialism based on Zeno’s
paradox of the arrow. All of them are based on premises that are arguably true and
inferences that are arguably valid (in either a deductive or non-deductive sense).
Although all these arguments can be disputed at various points, this is true of the
arguments for any interesting philosophical position. But, other things being equal (such
as the prospects of providing plausible answers to the objections to trivialism), we
should not judge trivialism with harsher standards than we would other philosophical
theories. But given the conclusion of chapter 3, there is really little motive for rejecting
such arguments. Trivialism is the rational view of reality.
Moreover, arguments against the possibility of being able to believe in trivialism fail to
be convincing, on several fronts. The idea that one cannot believe that each and every
sentence is true if one is to act in a discriminating manner does not seem to be true.
Moreover, even if this is a necessary condition for acting in a purposeful and
discriminating manner, it is not clear that one has to believe each and every sentence if
one is to qualify as a trivialist and for trivialism to play a role in the philosophical
community. One can act in a discriminating and purposeful manner if one is a trivialist.
Finally, because it is not possible for a proposition or set of propositions to express a
denial of trivialism, there is no such thing as a reason for rejecting trivialism. Arguments
that are supposedly against the truth of trivialism can only be understood as denials of
195
some other position such as an extreme form of dialetheism. But, as I have shown, even
in such a dialectic context, these arguments are less than convincing. Trivialism might
very well be deeply unpopular, but this unpopularity is undeserved. It is not trivialism
that is the odd man out. Rather, as I have argued, it is nontrivialism (the denial of
trivialism) that is most unusual and, given the conclusion of chapter 3, rather unintuitive
– it is nontrivialism that deserves the unpopularity.
Existential Implications of Trivialism?
I concluded chapter 4 by suggesting that trivialism might play an important role in a
system of salvation or liberation or at least a system with existential implications. I
would like to conclude the thesis by saying a little more about this. After all, I think that
if this thesis is to make a contribution to human flourishing (in some sense at least), it
will be along such lines. Although it is not the aim of this thesis to explicate and defend
the existential implications of trivialism, saying at least something in this regard may
help us to imagine why anyone would take on such a view of reality.
One way in which trivialism may have existential implications centers on the ancient
Greek idea of ataraxia. Roughly translatable as ‘tranquility’ or ‘freedom from trouble or
anxiety,’ the achievement of this state was seen as the primary goal of many of the Greek
schools of philosophy – among them Epicureanism, Stoicism, and various versions of
skepticism. All such schools made suggestions as to how one could best achieve ataraxia
and there is some reason for thinking that trivialism can make its own contribution
toward this most valued goal in life. If trivialism were true, then every state of affairs
196
obtains – good or bad. Moreover, they obtain without any effort on my part. The
trivialist then may offer the following wisdom to those burdened by the weight of the
world:
Why be worried? Because of the misfortune that befalls you? You regret not having taken
a different course of action? But necessarily all things obtain – including everything that
is bad for you. There was nothing you could have done to prevent this. So why regret
your past actions? Instead, be happy and relaxed. And besides, everything good obtains
too – you have missed out on nothing. The conditions for a peaceful, tranquil, and
meaningful life are here to enjoy. And there is nothing you need to do in order to ensure
that this remains so. Stop your worry, and be happy – and do whatever pleases you.
A conversion to trivialism then may very well bring me to a life of tranquility because of
its totalizing content. Anything bad could not have been prevented, and everything
good obtains regardless of my efforts. It might be objected, however, that the truth of
trivialism entails that I am in a state of anxiety and that there is nothing I can do about
this. This, of course, is correct, but it will do little to undermine the plausibility of this
program as a cure for anxiety. This is so for two reasons. First, trivialism just as surely
entails that we are in a state of ataraxia and that nothing will disturb this state (even if
the opposite of this is also true). Secondly, that there is nothing I can do about my state
of anxiety should lead me to release my anxiousness about this state of affairs: I should
not be anxious about my inevitable anxiety. Rather I should be at peace about it – and
this might very well release me from any anxiety entirely.
197
Such a trivialist program of course has certain similarities with the approach of
Pyrrhonist skepticism. For the pyrrhonist (at least on some readings of this ancient
wisdom) there is no good reason to believe that some state of affairs obtains as opposed
to some other. As such, we should merely go with the appearances of things and not
worry about whether we are taking the right course of action. There is no point fretting
over such issues; as such fretting presupposes that we have justification for our beliefs
concerning the true nature of things. And because we do not have such justification, we
should not have such beliefs. For the pyrrhonist it is a paucity of belief that will free us
from anxiety. But for the trivialist it is an abundance of belief that will frees us from
anxiety. In that sense then, the trivialist and the skeptic are polar opposites.231
Now I am not saying that I advocate such an approach to life. But what I am saying is
that it is possible to imagine how trivialism might contribute to the good life as it has
been traditionally conceived since ancient times. It might contribute in an analogous
way that the Pyrrhonist skeptic thought was possible with respect to that view of reality
– by removing the causes of anxiety. We have then some inkling of why a person might
be motivated to commit themselves to trivialism.
Trivialism as a Catalyst to Philosophical Development
It is difficult to know how to conclude a project of this sort. But perhaps the best way to
do so is to return to one of the motivations for this project mentioned in the introduction.

231 A point that has already been noted in Priest, “Could Everything be True?, 189-90.
198
Even if no one is persuaded by the arguments presented throughout this thesis, I do
hope that these arguments can stimulate philosophical discussion to the level of beauty
and sophistication that the phenomenon of skepticism has stimulated throughout the
history of philosophy. The function of radical positions in the philosophical community
is to act as the catalyst for the creative and intellectual activity of others. If anything I
would be happy for other philosophers to receive this thesis as an act of service that is in
the interests of our community at large rather than as an attempt to undermine what we
take to be most precious to us. We can only grow as a result of our reflections on the
concept of triviality.
